This directory is where default camera files are kept. It's very
much an abbreviated version of the files with no flat/dark data,
so you can get going.

Real versions of the data are built from info in

* `ABU-Exomars - AUPE\Calibration\PCOT calibration products` for AUPE
* `ABU-Exomars - PCOT\Camera Data` for training model and PanCam.
    
and should be dropped somewhere convenient.
