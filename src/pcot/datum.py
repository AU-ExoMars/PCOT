"""This deals with the different types of connections between xforms.
To add a new type, you need to add the type's brush
(for drawing) to the brushDict here, and you may also need to
add to isCompatibleConnection if you're doing something odd.
Note that types which start with "img" are image types, and
should all be renderable by Canvas.
These types are also used by the expression evaluator.
