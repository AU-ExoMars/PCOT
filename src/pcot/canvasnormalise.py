"""Image normalisation stuff for canvases.
This takes an image and an RGB image and generates a normalised RGB image. It can't just produce
an RGB image because the incoming image might be "premapped" by another node.

It will also:
    - only consider a rectangle of the image if required
    - TODO ignore "bad" pixels

Modes and their actions:
    NormSeparately: each rgb channel is normalised separately
    NormToRGB: each rgb channel is normalised to the range of RGB image's bands
    NormToImg: each rgb channel is normalised to the range all bands in the image
    NormNone: nothing is done

A boolean flag determines if the normalisation range is for the cropped image or the entire image.
