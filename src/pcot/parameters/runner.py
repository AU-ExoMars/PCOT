"""
The runner module is a thin wrapper around Document which provides a way to run a document
repeatedly with different parameters set from parameter files.

Sequence of actions:
    create doc
    create runner
        runner creates archive
        runner creates paramdict
    repeatedly
        call run
            apply parameter file to paramdict (which will mod. node params) and modify inputs
            run the document
            save output
            restore the document to its original state and rebuild paramdict

OR we can do this, modifying the parameters directly

    repeatedly
        modify parameter dictionary
        call run with no parameter file
            run the document
            save output
            restore the document to its original state and rebuild paramdict
