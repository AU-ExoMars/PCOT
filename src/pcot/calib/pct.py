# PCT geometry

# Numbering system is from the top left, as viewed in EXM-PC-DRW-ABU-0007_1.4_PCT_Drawing
# with the two large patches at the bottom. Tuples give x,y coordinates and radius in mm; origin is TOP LEFT.
# Note that the patches are elliptical, but the mean diameters are 19mm/31mm for small/large.
