"""Geometry of the PCT.

patches: the positions, radii, names and approx. colours of the PCT patches

Order of the patches is from the top left, as viewed in EXM-PC-DRW-ABU-0007_1.4_PCT_Drawing
with the two large patches at the bottom. Each patch has x,y coordinates and radius in mm, with origin
at top left; the patch name, and an RGB approximation of its colour.
Note that the patches are elliptical, but the mean diameters are 19mm/31mm for small/large.

screws: the positions of the three large mounting screws (not the corner holes)

width, height: overall PCT dimensions
