    This should be run on all patches, for each filter.

    Inputs:
        - rho: list of lab-measured reflectance readings, one for each patch.
        - signal: for each patch, a set of W.m^2.sr.nm spectral radiance readings from the rover.

    Returns m, c, sdm, sdc

        - m, c : slope and intercept of linear model mapping radiance to reflectance
        - sdm, sdc: uncertainty in the above in standard deviations
