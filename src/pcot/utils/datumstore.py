class DatumStore:
    """
    This class allows Datum objects to be stored into, and retrieved from, an Archive object. It is used to
    implement the PARC file format, which handles archives of Datum objects.

    Its simplest use is to store a single Datum object in an archive, but it can also be used to store multiple
    datum objects which it can handle in an LRU cache. This mode is used for handling collections of data used in
    calibration pipeline and pipeline emulation - flatfields and the like.

    This uses a LRU-cache of a slightly unusual kind, in that the size is specified in bytes. If reading
    a new item would exceed this size, least-recently-used items of non-zero size are removed until there
    is enough space. This is because Datum objects can be quite large, and we don't want to run out of memory.

    By default the cache is infinitely large, so objects will sit around until the store goes away!!!

    Usage example for writing:
            with FileArchive("foo.parc", "w") as a:
                da = DatumStore(a)
                da.writeDatum("bar", some_datum_object)
                da.writeDatum("baz", some_other_datum_object)

    Usage example for reading:
            a = DatumStore(FileArchive(fn), 1000)
            d = a.get("test", None)

    Note the difference - when writing, the archive is open for writing either using open() or inside a context manager.

    The Zip archive is only open while data is being written or read (PCOT archive objects - which this class uses -
    are context managers).

    Be VERY SURE that you don't keep any references to the Datum objects, or the LRU deletion won't work!
    
    Internal format: each item is a JSON file. Strings in that JSON which are of the form "ARAE-n" are actually
    numpy arrays stored in files of that name. This is handled by FileArchive.

    Each JSON file also has a metadata file with the same name but with a .meta extension. This is a JSON file
    containing a serialisation of a Metadata object. These are stored in the manifest dictionary.
