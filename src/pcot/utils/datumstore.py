class DatumStore:
    """
    This class allows Datum objects to be stored into, and retrieved from, an Archive object.
    It's mainly used for handling blocks of data used in calibration pipeline and pipeline emulation - flatfields
    and the like.

    It's not used for serialisation, however, because serialisation is primarily for storing XForms and graph data.

    This uses a LRU-cache of a slightly unusual kind, in that the size is specified in bytes. If reading
    a new item would exceed this size, least-recently-used items of non-zero size are removed until there
    is enough space. This is because Datum objects can be quite large, and we don't want to run out of memory.

    Usage example for writing:
        with FileArchive("foo.zip", "w") as a, DatumStore(a) as da:
            da.writeDatum("bar", some_datum_object)
            da.writeDatum("baz", some_other_datum_object)

    Which is sort-of the same as:

        with FileArchive("foo.zip", "w") as a:
            with DatumStore(a) as da:
                da.writeDatum("bar", some_datum_object)
                da.writeDatum("baz", some_other_datum_object)

    or you can do:

        with FileArchive("foo.zip", "w") as a:
            da = DatumStore(a)
            da.writeDatum("bar", some_datum_object)
            da.writeDatum("baz", some_other_datum_object)
            da.writeManifest()

    This is because we have to write the manifest at the end. The context manager will check we have the archive
    open in write mode, and will write the manifest automatically. If we're not using a CM we have to do it ourselves.

    Usage example for reading:
            a = DatumStore(FileArchive(fn), 1000)
            d = a.get("test", None)

    The Zip archive is only open while data is being written or read (PCOT archive objects - which this class uses -
    are context managers).

    Be VERY SURE that you don't keep any references to the Datum objects, or the LRU deletion won't work!
