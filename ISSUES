Optimisation: at the moment, setting an output causes a perform.
This means that (say) split, which sets three outputs, causes merge
to perform three times. It doesn't need to.

Loading files in source isn't optimal - let's say you're compositing
N different source greyscale files which aren't in the current directory.
You have to browse down the file tree for each one.

THINGS TO DO

HIGH WEIRDNESS can be reproduced by just opening the program and clicking
on the output of the default rgbfile.

Make mainwindow support multiple mainwindows into a single scene:
    remove references to the view from inside the scene (OK)
    remove link from node to tab (node may now link several tabs!) (OK)
    make cut-and-paste work across windows
    
Macros:
    optimisation is now required. Don't let nodes perform until
    ALL connected inputs have data (mark all nodes input data as "unset"
    (NOT none) at start of recursion, then set as you setOutput).
    
    

What to do if a loaded node doesn't exist (some kind of placeholder node with
dead outputs?) Or just panic (as we do right now?)


Macros. Dear God, macros.
