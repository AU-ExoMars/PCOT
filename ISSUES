Optimisation: at the moment, setting an output causes a perform.
This means that (say) split, which sets three outputs, causes merge
to perform three times. It doesn't need to.

Loading files in source isn't optimal - let's say you're compositing
N different source greyscale files which aren't in the current directory.
You have to browse down the file tree for each one.

THINGS TO DO

What to do if a loaded node doesn't exist (some kind of placeholder node with
dead outputs?) Or just panic (as we do right now?)


Macros. Dear God, macros.



Ellipse and Path ROIs, same as rectangle in usage.
