Optimisation: at the moment, setting an output causes a perform.
This means that (say) split, which sets three outputs, causes merge
to perform three times. It doesn't need to.

Loading files in source isn't optimal - let's say you're compositing
N different source greyscale files which aren't in the current directory.
You have to browse down the file tree for each one.


THINGS TO DO

0. Fix decorr stretch knob!

1. MD5 checksumming on nodes, to make sure that a graph saved with node X,
when loaded, is using the same code it was saved with. DONE

2. What to do if the above fails, or a node doesn't exist (some kind of
placeholder node with dead outputs?)

3. Node documentation: should be in a string in the file. If we add a
docstring to the class, we can access it with type(xformtypeobj).__doc__).
We should check it exists when a class is registered. We should also be 
able to open a non-modal popup containing it from all tabs.
