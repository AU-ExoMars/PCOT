Optimisation: at the moment, setting an output causes a perform.
This means that (say) split, which sets three outputs, causes merge
to perform three times. It doesn't need to.

THINGS TO DO

HIGH WEIRDNESS can be reproduced by just opening the program and clicking
on the output of the default rgbfile.

Make mainwindow support multiple mainwindows into a single scene:
    remove references to the view from inside the scene (OK)
    remove link from node to tab (node may now link several tabs!) (OK)
    make cut-and-paste work across windows
    
Graphs now own their scenes, which is a better idea but causes an
interesting problem given that scenes own the selection data. This
means that selection data will be shared across all windows open
on the same graph.

WORKING ON
     properties w and h - others?
     merge function - others?
     eval documentation!
     rgb function (and node?)
     pixels function for counting pixels in ROI
     some kind of "generic data" type?
     stats node outputting data - and a "data canvas"
     DOCSTRINGS



use-as-Library stuff:
    eval??
