Optimisation: at the moment, setting an output causes a perform.
This means that (say) split, which sets three outputs, causes merge
to perform three times. It doesn't need to.

Loading files in source isn't optimal - let's say you're compositing
N different source greyscale files which aren't in the current directory.
You have to browse down the file tree for each one.

TabRect is largely the same as TabInset.


THINGS TO DO

Fix "add"

Make sure all nodes:
    process subimages or say if they don't
    pass on or DON'T pass on ROIs - which is it?
    deal with all possible channel counts

What to do if a node doesn't exist (some kind of placeholder node with dead
outputs?)

Multiple source node (loads multiple greyscale files, output
is a number of greyscale channels)

Single source node to output either GS or RGB. Needs renaming

General ROI object type, which contains ref to original image
and ROI data (more efficient) (maybe this should be the general image
type, but that's potentially a lot of work).

Better crop (shows cropped area better). Outputs ROI type. Just call it
"rectangle". Can be annotated (like inset). Image output switchable between
crop and whole annotated image.

Ellipse and Path ROIs, same as rectangle in usage.

Canvas zoom?

Channel add and subtract

Remap greyscale to colour gradient.
