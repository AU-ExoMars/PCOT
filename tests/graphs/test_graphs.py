"""This package runs a set of tests which come from graph files. There should be a set of .pcot files, which
must contain graphs which (eventually) output TESTRESULT data to sink nodes. The system will automatically run
these graphs and check the results. Normally, the sinks must contain zero failures. If the graph's filename
contains MUSTFAIL then there must be at least one failure (this is to test the test system itself)."""
