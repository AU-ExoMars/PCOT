Really stuck with how to do "polymorphic" transforms. Consider a transform
which can take grey or RGB images, and then outputs a grey or RGB image.
That output's connection type depends on what it's doing as it runs, making
it hard to know what it can connect to.
Or does it? It's actually determined when the xform is wired up - 
some components change their output type depending on what their input
type is (or, perhaps, other things).

So perhaps input and output type should not be properties of the xformtype
but of the xform itself? Something to think about.

For now, there's a demonstration of a hack in curve, which produces two
different xforms in the palette.

Optimisation: at the moment, setting an output causes a perform.
This means that (say) split, which sets three outputs, causes merge
to perform three times. It doesn't need to.
