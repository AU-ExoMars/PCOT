It should be possible to have a single output connecting to multiple
inputs, but not multiple outputs into a single input.
The UI for this sort of works, but not quite; it's a bit messy to
wire and deleting a wire (pulling the output away) often disconnects
the wrong one.

This is because the two-way link in the model can't cope with
one output going to multiple inputs!
