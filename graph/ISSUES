Optimisation: at the moment, setting an output causes a perform.
This means that (say) split, which sets three outputs, causes merge
to perform three times. It doesn't need to.

Loading files in source isn't optimal - let's say you're compositing
N different source greyscale files which aren't in the current directory.
You have to browse down the file tree for each one.
