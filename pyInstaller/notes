Well, this *nearly* works but for two things:

0) had to edit the hook for matplotlib
        anaconda3/envs/pcot/lib/
            python3.8/site-packages/PyInstaller/hooks/hook-matplotlib.py
            
   first, change _get_data_path() to get_data_path().
   
   Then change the path from 'mpl-data' to 'matplotlib/mpl-data'.
   Here are the changes:
   
        mpl_data_dir = exec_statement(
            "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.get_data_path())")

        datas = [
            (mpl_data_dir, "matplotlib/mpl-data"),
        ]

   
1) the xforms don't get imported in __init__, which means the code
    that autoregisters them doesn't run. That can be fixed by
    putting a list of the modules by hand in xforms/__init__.py.
    THIS IS HORRIBLE.
    
    
2) I have to do
    cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb-shm.so.0 dist/main
   to get a version that works. Clearly some version problem somehow.
   THIS IS HORRIBLE. AND MEANS I CAN'T USE ONE-FILE.
   
3) scipy now throws a module missing, fixed by adding it to hidden modules.

4) adding a hidden module for every single custom widget I use
