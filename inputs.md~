# Loading different image formats

The examples in [the tutorial](../tutorial) use ENVI images, which aren't much use for real work.
Other image formats are available:

* plain RGB
* "multiband" images (multiple monochrome PNG images, one per band)
* PDS4 products (work in progress)

## Loading an RGB image
To load RGB, open an input
and click the RGB button. A dialog will appear which is very similar to the
[ENVI file dialog above](#inputenvi), 
butshowing ENVI header files instead of image files. Double-click on such a
file to load its associated data,
which is assumed to be in the same directory with the same name. RGB images don't
have filters, so there is no wavelength information - instead, the channels are named
R, G and B and these names can be used in *expr* nodes (e.g. ```a$R```).

## Loading a "multiband" image

Sometimes data is provided as a set of monochrome PNG files, although this is clearly far from ideal.
In this case we need to tell PCOT how to work out which filter is being used for each file. Again, we open
the dialog by clicking on an input button and clicking the appropriate method - "Multifile" in this case. This
will open the ENVI dialog, which is rather more complex than the RGB or ENVI dialogs:

The procedure here is roughly this:

* Make sure the file names contain the the lens (left or right) as L or R,
and the filter position number.
* Work out a regular expression which can find these in the file name.
Hopefully you can just use the default, which assumes that the filename 
contains a string like ```LWAC01``` for left lens, position 01; or
```RWAC10``` for right lens, position 10. If your filenames don't have this
format and it's too difficult to rename them, you'll have to write
an RE yourself or find a handy IT person to help.
* Get the files into a single directory and open the input dialog as shown
above.
* Determine which camera configuration - PANCAM or AUPE - produced the
images and set the Camera option accordingly. These two setups use
different filter sets, and will translate filter positions into different
filter wavelengths and names.
* Click the "Get Directory" button.
* In the new dialog, select a directory containing the ENVI .hdr files and
their accompanying .dat files, and click "Select Folder".
* A lot of files will appear in the Files box.
* Double-click images to preview them as a single channel.
If they are dark, select an appropriate multiplier and double-click again.
* Click in image checkboxes to select them; selected images will be combined into a single multispectral mage.

Close the dialog when you have the selected images you want. It might be a good idea to create an *input* node
to examine the resulting multispectral image.

## PDS4 products

This is very much work in progress - please contact the developers if you need
this functionality soon.
