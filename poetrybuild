* conda create -n pcot python=3.8 poetry
* conda activate pcot
* poetry install

Then you can just run it. Or if you want..

* pip3 install pyinstaller
* cd pyInstaller
* pyinstaller dir.spec (or main.spec for single file)

Note that it might seem odd that the exe is called pcotapp and not pcot;
that's because it creates a file with the exe name, and we need a directory
called 'pcot' as it's the top level package.
