* conda create -n pcot python=3.8 poetry
* conda activate pcot
* poetry install

Then you can just run it.

NOTE: below this point is uncharted territory since a few releases ago. It MIGHT still work, it might not.
It's best to use the above instructions.

Or if you want to build a stand-alone executable:

* pip3 install pyinstaller
* cd pyInstaller
* pyinstaller dir.spec (or main.spec for single file)

Note that it might seem odd that the exe is called pcotapp and not pcot;
that's because it creates a file with the exe name, and we need a directory
called 'pcot' as it's the top level package.
