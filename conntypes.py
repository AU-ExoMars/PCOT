# This deals with the different types of connections between
# xforms. To add a new type, you need to add the type's brush
# (for drawing) to the brushDict here, and you may also need to
# add to isCompatibleConnection if you're doing something odd.
# Note that types which start with "img" are image types, and
# should all be renderable by Canvas.
