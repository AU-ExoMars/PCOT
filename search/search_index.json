Note from that equation that x is biased, so that x=0.5 is the inflection point if c=0. dqset img,bits sets DQ bits flat val... Turns a list of vectors, images and numbers into a single vector, by flattening each into a 1D vector and concatenating them all together. Data with any of the dq.BAD bits is removed. fliph img Flip an image horizontally flipv img Flip an image vertically getflats img Given an image with single-channel bands from a known camera, return the flatfield images for each band as another image with the same band assignments as the input. The flats will come from the camera data for the camera. grey img opencv (0) Greyscale conversion. If the optional second argument is nonzero, and the image has 3 channels, we'll use CV's conversion equation rather than just the mean. However, this loses uncertainty information. Otherwise uncertainty is calculated by adding together the channels in quadrature and then dividing the number of channels. interp img,factor w (-1) Using trilinear interpolation, generate an image by interpolating between the bands of an existing image. If an ROI is attached, the image generated will be interpolated from the pixels in the ROI. The width of the image will be either given in an optional parameter, or will be the same as the input image. WARNING - IS VERY SLOW makeunc v1,u1,v2,u2 marksat img mn (0),mx (1.0) mark pixels outside a certain range as SAT or ERROR in the DQ bits. Pixels outside any ROI will be ignored, as will any pixels already marked as BAD. max val Find the maximum of a Datum. For a multiband image, returns a vector of the maximum of each band. For a single band image, a scalar, or a vector, returns a scalar. Pixels with \"bad\" DQ bits will be ignored. See also the mean val Find the mean\u00b1sd of a Datum. This does different things depending on what kind of Datum we are dealing with. For a scalar, it just returns the scalar. For a vector, it returns the mean and sd of the vector. For an image, it returns a vector of the means and sds of each channel. Pixels with \"bad\" DQ bits will be ignored. merge img1... merge a number of images into multiple bands of a single image. If the image has multiple bands they will all become bands in the new image. min val Find the minimum of a Datum. For a multiband image, returns a vector of the minimum value of each band. For a single band image, a scalar, or a vector, returns a scalar. Pixels with \"bad\" DQ bits will be ignored. See also the & (AND) operator, which will find the minimum of two values (or images, vectors etc). nominal d If input is an image, create an image made up of the nominal (mean) pixel values for all bands - i.e. an image with no uncertainty; if input is numeric, output the nominal value. Ignores ROIs. norm img splitchans (0) normalize all channels of an image to 0-1, operating on all channels combined (the default) or separately overlay img1,img2 Given a pair of images of the same dimensions and band count, replace all pixels in the first image with the second EXCEPT where the second image has the NODATA bit set. This is useful for combining two images where one image has \"holes\" (e.g. registration). reducecircles img,thresh useratio (0) Given an image with a set of circular ROIs, reduce all the radii until the maximum of the pooled SDs of the bands stops decreasing. The threshold value \"thresh\" is the value by which the SD must stop decreasing before we stop reducing the radius. This is useful for finding the smallest circle around a region of the same value. Alternatively, if an optional boolean is set, we just reduce every circle by a given ratio. resize img,width,height method (linear) Resize an image to a new size using OpenCV's resize function. The method is one of: \"nearest\", \"linear\", \"cubic\", \"area\", \"lanczos4\" mapping to the OpenCV constants cv2.INTER_NEAREST, cv2.INTER_LINEAR, cv2.INTER_CUBIC, cv2.INTER_AREA, cv2.INTER_LANCZOS rgb img create a 3-channel image consisting of the current RGB mapping of the input image. NOTE: changing the mapping on a node does NOT cause the downstream nodes to run - you will have to click \"Run All\" to make an expr node with rgb() recalculate itself. roi img Extract a single combined ROI from all ROIs on the image. If no ROIs are present, will return a single rectangular ROI covering the entire image. rotate img,angle Rotate an image anti-clockwise by an angle in degrees. The angle must be a multiple of 90 degrees. sd val Find the SD of a Datum. This does different things depending on what kind of Datum we are dealing with. For a scalar, it just returns 0. For a vector or single-channel image, it returns a scalar. For an image, it returns a vector of the SDs of each channel. Because each individual value in the input set can have its own uncertainty, the uncertainty is pooled - the pooled variance is the mean of the variances plus the variance of the means (Rudmin, J. W. (2010). Calculating the exact pooled variance. arXiv preprint arXiv:1007.1012). For pooling, we make the assumption that the number of items in each input subset (e.g. each pixel) is the same. Pixels with \"bad\" DQ bits will be ignored. setcwl img,cwl Given a 1-band image, create a 'fake' filter with a given centre wavelength and assign it. The transmission of the filter is 1.0, and the fwhm is 30. The image itself is unchanged. This is used in testing only. sin a Calculate sine of an angle in radians sqrt a Calculate square root striproi img stripannots (0) Strip all regions of interest from an image stripsources d Strip all sources from a datum, leaving the data intact. This is sometimes necessary in certain processing pipelines e.g. to avoid bands with multiple sources in spectrum nodes. sum val Find the sum of a Datum. For a multiband image, returns a vector of the sums of each band. For a single band image, a scalar, or a vector, returns a scalar. The uncertainty is pooled differently as this is a sum. The variance will be the variance of the means plus the sum of the variances (still following Rudmin, J. W. (2010). Calculating the exact pooled variance. arXiv preprint arXiv:1007.1012). Pixels with \"bad\" DQ bits will be ignored. tan a Calculate tangent of an angle in radians testf arg1,arg2 This \"docstring\" is mandatory in datumfuncs, because it contains the description and argument types. The function calculates a+2*b, correctly combining sources and propagating uncertainty. testf2 a b (2) Calculates a+b and a-b, creating a custom object to store that data. testimg index usetestfilters (0) Load a test image. uncertainty d If input is an image, create an image made up of uncertainty data for all bands; if input is numeric, output the uncertainty. Ignores ROIs. v n,u dqbits (0) create a new value with uncertainty by combining two values. These can be either numbers or images. \" Ignores and discards ROIs. valuesbyfilter img Rather like the spectrum node, this gathers together all the pixel values for an ROI. However, it just outputs them in a table by filter, not by frequency. Useful for collating certain kinds of calibration data. vec s1... Create a 1D numeric vector from several scalars or vectors. Expr properties Below are properties which can be used in the expression evaluation node, expr . Properties are names which can be used as identifiers on the right hand side of a \".\" operator, such as a.w to get the width of an image a . name type of x desc x.w img give the width of an image in pixels (if there are ROIs, give the width of the BB of the ROI union) x.w roi give the width of an ROI in pixels x.h img give the height of an image in pixels (if there are ROIs, give the width of the BB of the ROI union) x.h roi give the width of an ROI in pixels x.n img give the area of an image in pixels (if there are ROIs, give the number of pixels in the ROI union) x.n roi give the number of pixels in an ROI x.n number give the number of items in a vector x.u img return an new image containing the uncertainties of the image's pixels x.u number return the uncertainty of the scalar or vector (if vector, individual uncertainties will be pooled using Rudmin 2010). DQ is ignored. x.bands img return a vector of the centre wavelengths of each band in the image Input and output parameters for the parameter file (batch) runner Below are links to pages describing parameters for setting the inputs and outputs in batch files.

This does different things depending on what kind of Datum we are dealing with. For a scalar, it just returns the scalar. For a vector, it returns the mean and sd of the vector. For an image, it returns a vector of the means and sds of each channel. Pixels with \"bad\" DQ bits will be ignored. merge img1... merge a number of images into multiple bands of a single image. If the image has multiple bands they will all become bands in the new image. min val Find the minimum of a Datum. For a multiband image, returns a vector of the minimum value of each band. For a single band image, a scalar, or a vector, returns a scalar. Pixels with \"bad\" DQ bits will be ignored. See also the & (AND) operator, which will find the minimum of two values (or images, vectors etc). nominal d If input is an image, create an image made up of the nominal (mean) pixel values for all bands - i.e. an image with no uncertainty; if input is numeric, output the nominal value. Ignores ROIs. norm img splitchans (0) normalize all channels of an image to 0-1, operating on all channels combined (the default) or separately overlay img1,img2 Given a pair of images of the same dimensions and band count, replace all pixels in the first image with the second EXCEPT where the second image has the NODATA bit set. This is useful for combining two images where one image has \"holes\" (e.g. registration). reducecircles img,thresh useratio (0) Given an image with a set of circular ROIs, reduce all the radii until the maximum of the pooled SDs of the bands stops decreasing. The threshold value \"thresh\" is the value by which the SD must stop decreasing before we stop reducing the radius. This is useful for finding the smallest circle around a region of the same value. Alternatively, if an optional boolean is set, we just reduce every circle by a given ratio. resize img,width,height method (linear) Resize an image to a new size using OpenCV's resize function. The method is one of: \"nearest\", \"linear\", \"cubic\", \"area\", \"lanczos4\" mapping to the OpenCV constants cv2.INTER_NEAREST, cv2.INTER_LINEAR, cv2.INTER_CUBIC, cv2.INTER_AREA, cv2.INTER_LANCZOS rgb img create a 3-channel image consisting of the current RGB mapping of the input image. NOTE: changing the mapping on a node does NOT cause the downstream nodes to run - you will have to click \"Run All\" to make an expr node with rgb() recalculate itself. roi img Extract a single combined ROI from all ROIs on the image. If no ROIs are present, will return a single rectangular ROI covering the entire image. rotate img,angle Rotate an image anti-clockwise by an angle in degrees. The angle must be a multiple of 90 degrees. sd val Find the SD of a Datum. This does different things depending on what kind of Datum we are dealing with. For a scalar, it just returns 0. For a vector or single-channel image, it returns a scalar. For an image, it returns a vector of the SDs of each channel. Because each individual value in the input set can have its own uncertainty, the uncertainty is pooled - the pooled variance is the mean of the variances plus the variance of the means (Rudmin, J. W. (2010). Calculating the exact pooled variance. arXiv preprint arXiv:1007.1012). For pooling, we make the assumption that the number of items in each input subset (e.g. each pixel) is the same. Pixels with \"bad\" DQ bits will be ignored. setcwl img,cwl Given a 1-band image, create a 'fake' filter with a given centre wavelength and assign it. The transmission of the filter is 1.0, and the fwhm is 30. The image itself is unchanged. This is used in testing only. sin a Calculate sine of an angle in radians sqrt a Calculate square root striproi img stripannots (0) Strip all regions of interest from an image stripsources d Strip all sources from a datum, leaving the data intact. This is sometimes necessary in certain processing pipelines e.g. to avoid bands with multiple sources in spectrum nodes. sum val Find the sum of a Datum. For a multiband image, returns a vector of the sums of each band. For a single band image, a scalar, or a vector, returns a scalar. The uncertainty is pooled differently as this is a sum. The variance will be the variance of the means plus the sum of the variances (still following Rudmin, J. W. (2010). Calculating the exact pooled variance. arXiv preprint arXiv:1007.1012). Pixels with \"bad\" DQ bits will be ignored. tan a Calculate tangent of an angle in radians testf arg1,arg2 This \"docstring\" is mandatory in datumfuncs, because it contains the description and argument types. The function calculates a+2*b, correctly combining sources and propagating uncertainty. testf2 a b (2) Calculates a+b and a-b, creating a custom object to store that data. testimg index usetestfilters (0) Load a test image. uncertainty d If input is an image, create an image made up of uncertainty data for all bands; if input is numeric, output the uncertainty. Ignores ROIs. v n,u dqbits (0) create a new value with uncertainty by combining two values. These can be either numbers or images. \" Ignores and discards ROIs. valuesbyfilter img Rather like the spectrum node, this gathers together all the pixel values for an ROI. However, it just outputs them in a table by filter, not by frequency. Useful for collating certain kinds of calibration data. vec s1... Create a 1D numeric vector from several scalars or vectors.","title":"Expr functions"},{"location":"autodocs/#expr-properties","text":"Below are properties which can be used in the expression evaluation node, expr .

The node box will show the text of the expression. The \"run\" button must be clicked to set the node to the new expression and perform it. The input can accept any type of data and the output type is determined when the node is run. The four inputs are assigned to the variables a, b, c, and d. They are typically (but not necessarily) images or numeric values. The standard operators +,/,*,- and ^ all have their usual meanings. When applied to images they work in a pixel-wise fashion, so if a is an image, 2*a will double the brightness. If b is also an image, a+b will add the two images, pixel by pixel. There are two non-standard operators: . for properties and $ for band extraction. These are described below. Image/numeric operators: operator description precedence (higher binds tighter) A + B add A to B (can act on ROIs) 10 A - B subtract A from B (can act on ROIs) 10 A / B divide A by B (can act on ROIs) 20 A * B multiply A by B (can act on ROIs) 20 A ^ B exponentiate A to the power B (can act on ROIs) 30 -A element-wise negation of A (can act on ROIs) 50 A.B property B of entity A (e.g. a.h is height of image a) 80 A$546 extract single band image of wavelength 546 100 A$_2 extract single band image from band 2 explicitly 100 A&B element-wise minimum of A and B (Zadeh's AND operator) 20 A|B element-wise maximum of A and B (Zadeh's OR operator) 20 !A element-wise 1-A (Zadeh's NOT operator) 50 All operators can act on images, 1D vectors and scalars with the exception of . and $ which have images on the left-hand side and identifiers or integers on the right-hand side. Those operators marked with (can act on ROIs) can also act on pairs of ROIs (regions of interest, see below). Binary operations on image pairs These act by performing the binary operation on the two underlying Numpy arrays. This means you may need to be careful about the ordering of the bands in the two images, because they will simply be operated on in the order they appear. For example, consider adding two images $a$ and $b$ with the same bands in a slightly different order: image a image b result of addition 480nm 480nm sum of 480nm bands 500nm 500nm sum of 500nm bands 610nm 670nm a 's 610nm band plus b 's 670nm band 670nm 610nm copy of previous band (addition being commutative) This probably isn't what you wanted. Note that this is obviously not an issue when an operation is being performed on bands in a single image. Binary operators on images with regions of interest If one of the two images has an ROI, the operation is only performed on that ROI; the remaining area of output is taken from the image without an ROI. If both images have an ROI an error will result - it is likely that this is a mistake on the user's part, and doing something more \"intelligent\" might conceal this. The desired result can be achieved using expr nodes on ROIs and an importroi node. Operations with vectors Some functions can generate vectors, such as mean for getting the means of the bands, and vec for generating vectors by hand. If an image is used in a binary operation with a vector on the other side, the vector must have the same number of elements as there are bands in the image. The operation will be performed on each band. Consider a 3-band image and the vector [2,3,4] . If we multiply them, the result will an image with the first band multiplied by 2, the second band multiplied by 3, and the third band multiplied by 4. Operators on ROIs themselves (as opposed to images with ROIs) operator description a+b union a*b intersection a-b difference You can source ROIs from the \"roi\" output of ROI nodes, and impose resulting ROIs on images with \"importroi\" node. Band extraction The notation $name or $wavelength takes an image on the left-hand side and extracts a single band, generating a new monochrome image. The right-hand side is either a filter name, a filter position, a wavelength or a band index preceded by \"_\". Depending on the camera, all these could be valid: expression meaning a$780 the 780nm band in image a a$_2 band 2 in the image a (a+b)$G0 the band named G0 in the image formed by adding images a and b ((a+b)/2)$780 the average of the 780nm bands of images a and b Be aware of caveats in the \"binary operations on image pairs\" section above: it may be better to extract the band before performing the operation, thus: old expression better expression (a+b)$G0 a$G0 + b$G0 ((a+b)/2)$780 (a$780+b$780)/2 Brackets Round brackets are used to group expressions as usual, but square brackets are used for indexing into a vector. For example, a[3] will extract the fourth element of the vector a . However, square brackets cannot (yet) create a vector. To do this, use the vec function - so vec(1,2,3)[1] will return 2. Band extraction can also be performed with vectors provided the vector elements are numeric (i.e. wavelengths): a $ vec(640,550,440) is valid. Properties Properties are indicated by the . operator, e.g. a.w to find an image's width. Help on functions and properties A list of functions can be obtained by right-clicking on either the log pane or function entry pane and selecting \"List all functions.\" Help on an individual function can be found by hovering over the name of a function, right-clicking and selecting \"Get help on 'somefunction'\". Similar actions are supported for properties. Uncertainties are assumed to be independent in all binary operations While uncertainty is propagated through operations (as population standard deviation) all quantities are assumed to be independent (calculating covariances is beyond the scope of this system). Be very careful here. For example, the uncertainty for the expression tan(a) will be calculated correctly, but if you try to use sin(a)/cos(a) the uncertainty will be incorrect because the nominator and denominator are not independent.

One input image is designated as \"fixed\", the other as \"moving\". The node will find a transform that maps the moving image onto the fixed image, and a translation that will ensure that both images remain uncropped. The fixed image will be translated only, the moving image will be transformed and then translated. Both transformed images are output and can then be merged or overlaid in a separate node. The transform is found by designating points in each image which correspond to each other. The number of points must be the same in each image, and at least three (unless \"translate only\" is selected). The canvas view can show the moving input, the fixed image, the transformed moving image, or the transformed fixed image. All images are shown as greyscale (since the input images will likely have different frequency bands). The transform used is one of the following homographies: Euclidean - translation and rotation only Similarity - translation, rotation, and scaling; angles are preserved Affine - translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing; parallel lines are preserved Projective - translation, rotation, scaling, shearing, and perspective; straight lines are preserved Points are added to the moving image by clicking with ctrl. Points are adding to the fixed image by clicking with shift. If only the moving or fixed points are shown, either shift- or ctrl-clicking will add to the appropriate point set. The selected point can be deleted with the Delete key (but this will modify the numbering!)

One input image is designated as \"fixed\", the other as \"moving\". The node will find a transform that maps the moving image onto the fixed image, and a translation that will ensure that both images remain uncropped. The fixed image will be translated only, the moving image will be transformed and then translated. Both transformed images are output and can then be merged or overlaid in a separate node. The transform is found by designating points in each image which correspond to each other. The number of points must be the same in each image, and at least three (unless \"translate only\" is selected). The canvas view can show the moving input, the fixed image, the transformed moving image, or the transformed fixed image. All images are shown as greyscale (since the input images will likely have different frequency bands). The transform used is one of the following homographies: Euclidean - translation and rotation only Similarity - translation, rotation, and scaling; angles are preserved Affine - translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing; parallel lines are preserved Projective - translation, rotation, scaling, shearing, and perspective; straight lines are preserved Points are added to the moving image by clicking with ctrl. Points are adding to the fixed image by clicking with shift. If only the moving or fixed points are shown, either shift- or ctrl-clicking will add to the appropriate point set.

Each XForm points to a pcot.xform.XFormType singleton which controls its behaviour. Nodes (XForms) communicate by passing pcot.datum.Datum objects. Each Datum points to a pcot.datumtype.Type subclass singleton providing serialisation, copy, and display facilities. They also have values - two common value classes are pcot.imagecube.ImageCube for images, and pcot.value.Value objects for other arrays and scalars. ImageCubes can generate SubImageCube objects which are subsets of the image covered by ROIs and with bad pixels masked out (\"bad\" according to the data quality bits). pcot.xform.XFormGraph This represents the graph of nodes which take data from inputs and perform operations on them. There is one inside the document, and instances of macros also contain their own graphs (and the macro itself contains a \"template\" graph from which these are created). A graph contains: A set of pcot.xform.XForm objects (usually called nodes ) connected together by their inputs fields, which are tuples of (source node, index of output). A graph runs by finding those nodes which have no inputs and performing them; the entire graph will be recursively traversed. Nodes are only run if their inputs have data (if their parent nodes have run). pcot.xform.XForm All nodes are of the same type. Polymorphism - different nodes behaving differently - is accomplished through each node having a reference to a pcot.xform.XFormType object in its type member that controls its behaviour. Nodes communicate by passing pcot.datum.Datum objects. When a node runs its perform method It reads the inputs by deferencing the inputs fields and getting the input node and index of the output of that node, and reading the Datum stored in that output. It processes the data and stores the results in its outputs field as Datum objects. It then performs its \"child\" nodes. pcot.datum.Datum This is the fundamental data type, used both for communicating between nodes and handling values in the expr node. A Datum has a type , which is a pcot.datumtypes.Type object a value , whose type depends on the type field a source indicating where the data came from If the value is None , the Datum is null. There is a constant Datum.null for null data. pcot.datumtypes.Type The DatumType object provides methods for serialisation, copying, and display. Each is a singleton. It's easy to create custom DatumTypes. The most commonly used builtins are: Datum.IMG : contains an ImageCube Datum.NUMBER : contains a Value (these names are for the singleton objects, not their types - for example, Datum.IMG has the type pcot.datumtypes.ImgType .) pcot.imagecube.ImageCube This is the fundamental image type, consisting of image data - 2D (H x W) if there is only one band (channel), 3D otherwise (H x W x D). Type is float32. uncertainty data , same shape and type as image data. This is the standard deviation of each pixel. DQ data . This a 16-bit bitfield for each pixel. Some of these are considered errors - these are called \"bad\" DQ bits (e.g. no uncertainty, saturated, results from a division by zero). regions of interest annotations that have been added to the image mapping used to render the image as RGB sources for each band pcot.imagecube.SubImageCube These objects can be generated by calling the subimg() method on an ImageCube. They are the subset of an image covered by the regions of interest it has, along with a mask for those regions. Additionally, \"bad\" parts of the image (which can be different in different bands) can be masked out. Operations on images are typically done on these subimages, and then modifyWithSub is called on the imagecube to return a copy of that imagecube with the modified subimage spliced in. Useful subimage methods include: masked() : return the masked nominal image data maskedUncertainty() : return the masked uncertainty data maskedDQ() : return the masked DQ bits All these return numpy masked arrays. pcot.value.Value This is the fundamental numeric type, consisting of nominal value uncertainty value (standard deviation) DQ bits It's usually used for scalars but can also hold array data - internally ImageCubes (or parts of them) are converted into array Values for maths. If it does hold array data, the three elements must be the same shape. It's possible to create 1D vectors in an expr node using square brackets, and some functions and operations return such vectors. This type supports mathematical operations which propagate uncertainty and DQ. More on how Values work here Note : You may wonder why ImageCube and SubImageCube don't use Value internally.

This page discusses three ways to do this, although the various elements can be easily blended in a single program: Loading a PCOT document, reading some data and passing it through the document's graph; Building a PCOT document programmatically and passing data through it; Using PCOT functions and data types without a graph. While the latter two techniques can be useful for quick ad-hoc work, on the whole we feel it is better to exchange PCOT documents for traceability and clarity. Loading and running PCOT documents A typical example might be a script to read a PCOT document and run some data through that document's graph. You could do that like this: # This example opens a graph, process some ENVI files through that graph, # and saves them back to an ENVI. It assumes the graph has an \"input 0\" node # which receives an image and a \"sink\" node which receives the processed # image. import pcot from pcot.document import Document from pcot.datum import Datum from pcot.dataformats.envi import write # initialise PCOT pcot.setup() # load the document doc = Document(\"1.pcot\") # run the graph for some ENVI files. We'll just do one here, the ENVI # document contained in the files 1.hdr and 1.dat (an ENVI document # consists of two files: header and data). for file in (\"1\",): # load the given ENVI file into input 0 rv = doc.setInputENVI(0, file+\".hdr\") if rv is not None: raise Exception(f\"{rv}\") # run the document's graph doc.run() # get the \"sink\" node outNode = doc.getNodeByName(\"sink\") # get its output img = outNode.out.get(Datum.IMG) # write to new ENVI, e.g. 1b.hdr write(file+\"b\",img) Building a PCOT document It's also possible to build a PCOT document, creating nodes within its graph. Consider the graph Figure: A simple graph. Click on image to expand. This could be built and run for a particular file with the following code: #!/usr/bin/env python import pcot import pcot.document from pcot.datum import Datum pcot.setup() doc = pcot.document.Document() result = doc.setInputENVI(0, \"/home/white/PCOT/fff.hdr\") is not None assert result is not None # create a document with just an input node in it, to bring that input into the document's graph innode = doc.graph.create(\"input 0\") # add a region of interest (ROI) node to the image roinode = doc.graph.create(\"circle\") # set the circle to be centred at (32,32) with a radius of 3 pixels roinode.roi.set(32,32,3) # connect its first input to the input node's first output # args: # input on this node to connect # node to get connection from # index on that node to connect to. roinode.connect(0,innode,0) # connect a node to the ROI node which takes the resulting image-with-ROI # and plots the spectrum of that ROI specnode = doc.graph.create(\"spectrum\") specnode.connect(0,roinode,0) # run the document doc.run() # get the output of the spectrum node, which will be a Datum, # and dereference the Datum, ensuring that the data is of the right type. # The result will be a Table object. output = specnode.getOutput(0, Datum.DATA) # print the table as CSV. print(output) Using PCOT functions and data types without a graph Often it is much simpler to just use the underlying PCOT data types without a graph.

If you don't know what that means, you're either in the wrong place or haven't read Writing PCOT plugins . Most nodes need to store some data. Sometimes this data can just be stored directly, as attributes of the XForm object (i.e. the node). It's not really \"polite\" programming, but this is the kind of thing you can do with Python. However, often \"parameter\" data controlling how the node operates needs to be saved inside the PCOT document file, and loaded when we reopen the file. For example, the expr node needs to store a string: the expression to be run. Parameters for some nodes can be complicated: multidot needs to be able to store a list of circular regions of interest, for example. We also need to do this to handle undo operations - every time a change is made, the entire document is \"saved\" into an archive in memory so it can be undone. This process - converting node data into data which can be saved to archives - is called serialisation , and there no less than four different mechanisms for doing it. This is largely for historical reasons, but also because the different mechanisms serve different needs: In order of preference, with the best at the top: TaggedAggregate serialisation - the data is JSON-serialisable but we want to make it possible to edit it from a batch/parameter file (see batch mode ). Probably the best choice if you can. complex serialisation via TaggedAggregate - the data is not serialisable, but we want to edit it from a parameter file. Probably the second-best and suitable where simple TA-serialisation can't handle the more complex data involved. autoserialisation - for when your data is already JSON-serialisable and you don't need to edit it from a parameter file. It is very simple to implement, but doesn't allow editing from a batch file and doesn't document itself automatically. Used only in legacy nodes. complex serialisation - for when your data is not directly JSON-serialisable (for example, regions of interest) and you don't need to edit it from a parameter file because it makes no sense (such as painted ROIs) TaggedAggregate serialisation This is the method we use when we want to be able to edit the parameters of nodes in batch mode, using parameter files (see batch mode ). It is probably the best method to use because of this, but it is rather more complicated. We make use of tagged aggregate structures , which can be found in pcot.utils.taggedaggregate . These are dictionaries and lists, but each has a formal, typed structure with \"tags\" giving the names of the members, their types, and default values. Each is described by a type singleton object which provides descriptions of its elements (these are the \"tags\" in the name). Calling create() on the singleton builds an instance of the structure with all the values filled in with defaults. TaggedDictType The main type used is TaggedDictType , which describes the format of a set of key/value pairs. Calling create() on one of these objects builds a TaggedDict object containing the default values. The TaggedDictType constructor takes a set of keyword arguments. Each key is the same of an element in the dict, and each value describes that element as a tuple of: a description used in the documentation a type: either a primitive type such as int or str, or another TaggedAggregateType subclass for nested structures a default value (must be None for aggregates, which provide their own defaults) for string values, an optional list of acceptable strings If you call setOrdered on the constructed type object you will get an \"ordered dict\" - this will be serialised as a tuple with the contained data having an implicit ordering. You might wonder why we don't make all tagged dicts ordered, so they are all serialised as tuples. The answer is that doing that would make it harder to implement backcompatibility - if we serialise as a tuple, adding and removing fields in the future becomes difficult. Only use ordered dicts for things where we are very unlikely to change the structure. One advantage is that it is possible to set all values in an ordered dict in one line inside a batch file. For example, here is a TaggedDictType definition for a rectangle: taggedRectType = TaggedDictType( x=(\"The x coordinate of the top left corner\", Number, 0), y=(\"The y coordinate of the top left corner\", Number, 0), w=(\"The width of the rectangle\", Number, 10), h=(\"The height of the rectangle\", Number, 10)).setOrdered() We are using Number here to indicate that either ints or floats are acceptable. We can then create a rectangle TaggedDict and access its values: r = taggedRectType.create() # create TaggedDict from type print(f\"Rectangle at {r.x}, {r.y}\") # show values r.w = 20 # set values r.h = 30 Bear in mind that there are functions for generating rectangle and colour type object in pcot.utils.taggedaggregates: taggedColourType and taggedRectType. You probably shouldn't create a rectangle type yourself. We can also specify that a parameter is another TaggedDict , allowing us to build complex nested structures. Here we nest the taggedRectType we defined above in another dict type: taggedThingType = TaggedDictType( rect=(\"The rectangle\", taggedRectType), somenumber=(\"Some numerical value\",Number,0)) TaggedListType These objects describe lists, and calling create() on them generates a TaggedList item. This is rarely done directly - it's more usual for a TaggedDictType to specify that one of its values is a list, in which case the list object is created when the containing TaggedDict is created. Here's an example where the dict contains both our rectangle type and a list of rectangles: taggedThingType = TaggedDictType( main=(\"The main rectangle\", taggedRectType), others=(\"Some other rectangles\", TaggedListType(taggedRectType,0)), somenumber=(\"Some numerical value\",Number,0)) We can then create our parameters and add a new default rect to the list: thing = taggedThingType.create() listOfThings.others.append_default() We can then access these items: print(taggedThingType.others.[0].x) The TaggedListType constructor takes the following arguments: Type of item (must be a TaggedAggregateType subclass or a primitive type - int, str, etc.) Default length (if a list of aggregates) or default list (if a list of primitives) Optional default value to append when a new item is created, ignored for lists of aggregates which will create their own default item For more details on how to use these structures, read the tests in tests/test_taggedaggs.py . You'll note that all the elements of a TaggedAggregate structure are JSON-serialisable 1 , although some can be numpy arrays. However, the nature of the structure allows defaults - and documentation - to be generated automatically. Using TaggedAggregates to serialise nodes To use a TaggedAggregate to serialise node data, create a TaggedDictType and assign it to the params member of the XFormType in the constructor. For example: self.params = TaggedDictType( mul=(\"multiplicative factor (done first)\", float, 1.0), add=(\"additive constant (done last)\", float, 0.0)) When a new node is created, a default structure will be created from this type and stored in the node's params field where it can be accessed from the perform method: output = node.params.add + node.params.mul * node.getInput(0, Datum.IMG) When the node is serialised, the structure will be serialised. complex TaggedAggregate serialisation (CTAS) The previous method dealt with data which can be JSON-serialised directly. If we need to modify non-JSON-serialisable data with parameter files, we need to do something similar to the complex serialisation method described above but going through a TaggedAggregate: we set the TaggedAggregate from our complex data, and then PCOT will serialise that. To do this, we write code as before to store the data in a TaggedDict in node.params , and we store any simple data we have in that structure. Then we write a serialise method containing code which converts our more complex data into a simpler form and stores it in node.params so it can be serialised. Here's an example: def serialise(self, node): # fill in the node.params with data node.params.foo = some_data_or_other node.params.bar = some_data_or_other # we don't return anything, because node.params will have been set to # represent our data; we don't need to add anything directly to the # JSON-serialisable dict. return None This method is also used by the legacy serialisation mechanism, where it would return a JSON dict directly. Here we need to return None instead. We must also write a nodeDataFromParams method. This takes a node, and uses its params field (which will be a TaggedDict, of course) to set the node's internal data: def nodeDataFromParams(self, node): # convert some data in node.params into our own private data our_data = some_function_of(node.params.foo, node.params.bar) Maybe Types and TaggedAggregate type objects can be \"wrapped\" in Maybe objects if they might be null: tdt = TaggedDictType( a=(\"a\", int, 10), b=(\"b\", Maybe(str), \"foo\"), # string or null c=(\"c\", float, 3.14) ) td = tdt.create() # create new dict td.b = \"hello\" # this is fine td.b = None # and so is this Note: I would have used Optional from the typing package, but that can only take actual types - not the type objects we use here. Avoid using Maybe for tagged aggregates etc., because you can't create a new one using a parameter file, just modify values in an existing one. TaggedVariantDicts Sometimes it is necessary to store different kinds of object in a list. We can do this with TaggedAggregates, provided the objects are all TaggedDicts and there is a field in all the dicts which tells us which type it is - a \"discriminator\". You can find more details on TVDs here Where to find examples Probably the most complex but straightforward example of CTAS is the gradient node. This converts a monochrome image to a false colour RGB gradient based on a set of gradient colours. This exists as a pcot.utils.gradient.Gradient object which is a wrapper around a list of (x,(r,g,b)) tuples defining the colour r,g,b at value x . The CTAS methods are responsible for converting tagged aggregate data and this Gradient object. They also handle a preset string which can override the data when set from a parameter file . Regions of interest are a rather more complex example... Autoserialisation This is the serialisation method used for a few legacy nodes and nodes which don't require batch editing, like comment . In the simplest case, the data stored in the XForm object for a particular node is already JSON-serialisable: that is, it is either a Python primitive type (number, string, tuple, list or dict) or a Numpy array (PCOT handles serialising these automatically). In this case you can simply list the names of the attributes in a tuple called autoserialise in the XFormType , along with some defaults which are used in case the items are not found in the saved data. For example, the constructor for XFormSpectrum could look like this (not any more, because it now uses TA-serialisation): super().__init__(\"spectrum\", \"data\", \"0.0.0\") self.autoserialise = ('sortlist', 'errorbarmode', 'legendFontSize', 'axisFontSize', 'stackSep', 'labelFontSize', 'bottomSpace', 'colourmode', 'rightSpace', # these have defaults because they were developed later. ('ignorePixSD', False), ('bandwidthmode', BANDWIDTHMODE_NONE), ) for i in range(NUMINPUTS): self.addInputConnector(str(i), Datum.IMG, \"a single line in the plot\") self.addOutputConnector(\"data\", Datum.DATA, \"a CSV output (use 'dump' or 'sink' to read it)\") Note that the default values are optional - if you don't specify a default you can just use the attribute name rather than a (name, default) tuple, but you will get an error if you try to load from data which doesn't have that attribute stored. When the system serialises the node it will read the named fields from the node, and it will do the reverse when it deserialises a node (i.e. load it from an archive). Complex serialisation In this case, we have data which isn't JSON-serialisable, and where it doesn't make any sense to have the parameters editable outside the PCOT user interface. Here, we add serialise and deserialise methods to the XFormType to convert our data to and from data which is JSON-serialisable. The serialise method will take the node and return a dict (which is JSON-serialisable), while the deserialise method will take the node and the dict and set the appropriate values a newly created node. The dict returned by serialise will be merged with the dict generated by autoserialisation and other, general node data (e.g. canvas data). Make sure you use unique names and not any of: canvas, displayName, inputTypes, ins, outs, mapping, md5, type, ver, w, xy, outputTypes An example: imagine our node stores a list of objects of some class Foo . We could write our methods thus: def serialise(self, node): return {'foolist': [(x.a, x.b) for x in node.foo_list]} def deserialise(self, node, d): node.foo_list = [Foo(a, b) for a, b in d['foolist']] In this case we are converting the Foo objects into tuples to serialise them, and constructing them from the tuples when we deserialise. It would probably be better to write Foo so that it can serialise itself and has a deserialise constructor: class Foo: def __init__(self...): ... def serialise(self)->dict: return ... @staticmethod def deserialise(d: dict): return Foo(...) and def serialise(self, node): return {'foolist': [x.serialise() for x in node.foo_list]} def deserialise(self, node, d): node.foo_list = [Foo.deserialise(x) for x in d['foolist']] i.e. they can be turned directly into JSON - they are primitive types (int, float, str etc.), dicts, lists, or tuples. \u21a9","title":"Node serialisation"},{"location":"devguide/nodeser/#node-serialisation","text":"This page discusses how to serialise the parameters for node types.

We could write our methods thus: def serialise(self, node): return {'foolist': [(x.a, x.b) for x in node.foo_list]} def deserialise(self, node, d): node.foo_list = [Foo(a, b) for a, b in d['foolist']] In this case we are converting the Foo objects into tuples to serialise them, and constructing them from the tuples when we deserialise. It would probably be better to write Foo so that it can serialise itself and has a deserialise constructor: class Foo: def __init__(self...): ... def serialise(self)->dict: return ... @staticmethod def deserialise(d: dict): return Foo(...) and def serialise(self, node): return {'foolist': [x.serialise() for x in node.foo_list]} def deserialise(self, node, d): node.foo_list = [Foo.deserialise(x) for x in d['foolist']] i.e. they can be turned directly into JSON - they are primitive types (int, float, str etc.), dicts, lists, or tuples. \u21a9","title":"Complex serialisation"},{"location":"devguide/plugins/","text":"Writing PCOT plugins The plugin path PCOT can be extended by adding Python scripts to a directory in the plugin path. By default this is just pcotplugins in the user's home directory, but it can be changed by editing the .pcot.ini file in that directory and modifying the pluginpath value in the Locations section. This should be a semicolon-separated list of directories. You may be tempted to use quotes in the names of you plugin directories: don't. It should work fine, even if your directories have spaces in them. For example, use ~/blah/RIM Dewarping and not ~/blah/\"RIM Dewarping\" Adding new types This is covered in a separate document , as it's not often done and is a little involved. Adding new Datum functions (for use in expr and Python code) The functions used in the expr expression node can also be used in Python programs which use PCOT as a library (this is covered here ). These are called Datum functions because they both take and return Datum objects. To create a Datum function: use the @datumfunc decorator. This will register the function and wrap it in two separate wrappers: one for use in expr , the other for use in Python. write a docstring in the correct format, as illustrated below. Here's an example which declares a function to take two numbers a,b and calculate a+b*2. Note that as in all PCOT code we have to make sure the sources are handled correctly. @datumfunc def example_func(a, b): \"\"\" Example function that takes two numbers a,b and returns a+b*2 @param a: number: first number @param b: number: second number \"\"\" return a + b * Datum.k(2) This is a trivial example that relies on Datum objects having operator overloads, but note that we need to multiply b by a Datum, not a number. To do this we use Datum.k to create a scalar constant. The docstring This should consist of a number of lines describing the function followed by a number of @param lines, one for each parameter. These contain the following, separated by colons: The string `@param' A Datum type name - these can be found in the constructors of datum type objects in datumtypes.py , but the most common are number , img , roi , string . A description of the parameter Optional numeric/string arguments Optional arguments with defaults can be provided, but only if they are numeric or strings (because these are the only types which make sense for the default values). In this case the defaults will be converted to Datum objects if they are used. Here is an example of a function which multiplies an image by a constant, with the default being 2: @datumfunc def example_func(img, k=2): \"\"\" Example function that takes two numbers a,b and returns a+b*2 @param img:img:the image @param k:number:the multiplier \"\"\" # no need to construct a Datum with Datum.k(), because k is already # a Datum. return img * k Here's another example which adds two numbers or multiplies them, depending on a string - and the default is to add: @datumfunc def stringexample(a, b, op='add'): \"\"\" String argument example @param a: number: first number @param b: number: second number @param op: string: operation to perform \"\"\" if op.get(Datum.STRING) == 'add': return a + b elif op.get(Datum.STRING) == 'sub': return a - b else: raise ValueError(\"Unknown operation\") Note that you usually have to extract the actual value from the Datum objects, as we do with the op argument above. In previous examples, we take advantage of Datum's extensive operator overloading. Variadic arguments For a variable number of arguments, use the *args keyword. Here, you have to check the types by hand. For example, this function will sum numbers: @datumfunc def sumall(*args): \"\"\" Sum all arguments \"\"\" s = sum([x.get(Datum.NUMBER).n for x in args]) return Datum(Datum.NUMBER, Value(s, 0, NOUNCERTAINTY), nullSourceSet) Note the use of Value here to construct a scalar value with standard deviation (zero here) and DQ bits (indicating no uncertainty data). Also note the mandatory use of a source set - just the nullSourceSet here to indicate there is no source; this is just a test function. In a real function we would combine the input sources. For more examples of functions, look at the ExpressionEvaluator constructor in the pcot.expressions.eval module. Adding new menu items This is done by adding a function to a list of functions called when a a main window is opened. Writing code here will require some knowledge of Qt. Here is a menu option added to the File menu which will look for selected node in the document's graph, fetch its first output, and save it as an ENVI file (assuming it is an image - error checking is left as an exercise for the reader). import pcot import os from PySide2 import QtWidgets from PySide2.QtWidgets import QAction, QMessageBox from pcot.dataformats import envi def saveEnvi(w): \"\"\"Function takes a PCOT main window. It finds the first selected node, gets its output 0, and then saves an ENVI from that image.\"\"\" sel = w.doc.getSelection() if len(sel) == 0: ui.log(\"no selected node\") return node = sel[0] directory = os.path.expanduser(pcot.config.getDefaultDir('pcotfiles')) res = QtWidgets.QFileDialog.getSaveFileName(w, \"ENVI file \", os.path.expanduser(pcot.config.getDefaultDir('pcotfiles')), \"ENVI files (*.hdr)\") if res[0] != '': # get the output of that node (root, ext) = os.path.splitext(res[0]) img = node.getOutput(0,pcot.datum.Datum.IMG) envi.write(root,img) # the function to add the new menu item. This will take a single parameter: # the window to which the menu should be added. def addMenus(w): \"\"\"Add an item to the Edit menu\"\"\" # create the menu action (i.e. the item) act = QAction(\"save to ENVI\",parent=w) # find (or create) the Edit menu and add the action to it w.findOrAddMenu(\"Edit\").addAction(act) # link the action to the saveEnvi function, using a closure to # make sure the window argument is passed into that function. act.triggered.connect(lambda: saveEnvi(w)) # Add the addMenus functions to the list of functions called as the # main window opens. pcot.config.addMainWindowHook(addMenus) Adding new node types Node types are represented by singletons of subclasses of XFormType (Nodes themselves are of type XForm , which stands for transform for historical reasons). Developing new XFormType subclasses is largely beyond the scope of this document, but you can learn a lot from looking at the pcot.xforms package and the modules therein. A commented example node can be found in xforms/xformexample.py . To create a new node type, declare a new subclass of XFormType and decorate it with the @xformtype decorator. This will make the type autoregister: the singleton will be constructed and added to the internal type registry. You will need to write the following methods in your subclass: __init__(self) to construct the type object (NOT the individual nodes). This will call the superconstructor to set the type's name, group (for the palette), and version. It will add the input and output connectors. init(self, node) will initialise any private data in the node itself (which is an XForm ). Don't confuse this with __init__ ! createTab(self, node, window) will create a new node area (i.e. tab). Often, this can be a TabData which will look at the node's out attribute, which should be a Datum. perform(self, node) will actually perform the node's action, reading inputs and setting outputs. Remember: there is only one XFormType object for each node type. All nodes are of type XForm , and they link to an XFormType object to tell them how to behave. This might seem a really odd way to do things, but it follows \"favour composition over inheritance\" and saves messiness elsewhere. Here is an example which does edge detection with OpenCV: import cv2 as cv import numpy as np from pcot.sources import SourceSet from pcot.xform import XFormType, xformtype, Datum from pcot.xforms.tabdata import TabData from pcot.imagecube import ImageCube import pcot.config # The first part of the plugin creates a new type of node. # this decorator will cause the node to auto-register. @xformtype class XFormEdgeDetect(XFormType): \"\"\"This is an edge detector node. It takes an image and performs Canny edge detection, currently with fixed thresholds. It does not take account of ROIs, since this would be pointless when we're converting from a potentially multispectral image to greyscale (well, boolean). Exercise for the reader - add variable thresholds, either as numeric inputs or as numeric parameters settable from the node tab.\"\"\" def __init__(self): # this node should appear in the maths group. super().__init__(\"edge\", \"maths\", \"0.0.0\") # set input and output - they are images and are unnamed. self.addInputConnector(\"\", Datum.IMG) self.addOutputConnector(\"\", Datum.IMG) def createTab(self, n, w): # there is no custom tab, we just use a data canvas. This expects \"node.out\" to be set to # either None or a Datum. return TabData(n, w) def init(self, n): # No initialisation required. pass def perform(self, node): # get the input image img = node.getInput(0, Datum.IMG) if img is not None: # find mean of all channels - construct a transform array and then use it. mat = np.array([1 / img.channels] * img.channels).reshape((1, img.channels)) grey = cv.transform(img.img, mat) # convert to 8-bit integer from 32-bit float img8 = (grey * 255).astype('uint8') # Perform edge detection out = cv.Canny(img8, 100, 200) # Convert back to 32-bit float out = (out / 255).astype('float32') # create the imagecube and set node.out for the canvas in the tab img = ImageCube(out, None, img.sources) node.out = Datum(Datum.IMG, img) else: # no image on the input, set node.out to None node.out = Datum.null # output node.out node.setOutput(0, node.out) Writing custom Tabs As noted above, a new XFormType subclass (i.e. a new node type) can often just use TabData , which will display the Datum stored on its first output (output 0). Sometimes, however, a custom tab needs to be written. This can be a complex task, but an example is given in xformexample.py in the xforms package. All the standard XFormTypes are in this package, so you can also look at them. The basic idea is: Create a subclass of pcot.ui.tabs.Tab Write the constructor to call the superclass constructor and create the UI (or load a Designer-created UI by passing an argument to the superclass. constructor), and call self.nodeChanged() at the end to refresh the tab from the node. Override onNodeChanged() to update the tab from the node. Use the Qt signal/slot mechanism to connect the tab's controls to methods in the tab class and write code to update the node from the tab in these methods, calling self.changed() at the end of each method. The tab will have a node field which addresses the node it is viewing (but see below for a \"gotcha\" - the value of this field will change after an undo operation!) Using Canvas in custom tabs Creating a Canvas programmatically is straightforward, and there is an example of this in xformexample.py . If you are creating a tab in Designer, you need to add a canvas as a QWidget which you then \"promote\" to a custom control (the canvas). In the promote dialog, the class should be Canvas and the header file pcot.ui.canvas (i.e. the package name). In your onNodeChanged() method you will need to update the canvas. This involves doing a little setup, then getting the image we want to display - usually the output - and telling the canvas to display it: # do some setup self.canvas.setNode(self.node) # then display the image img = self.node.getOutput(0, Datum.IMG) self.canvas.display(img) The setup synchronises the canvas with the node, telling the canvas about the RGB mappings and that it should store data in the node for serialisation. We have to set that up each time because of how undo works, which is discussed in the next section. Undo and references to data in nodes This is a major \"gotcha.\" Whenever an undo occurs, the old node is discarded and a new node created from a previously archived version in memory. This means that the node field changes. Because of this, your tab must not store references to objects inside the node, because after an undo those references will be stale. Instead, always use self.node... to access data. It is OK to use the tab to store UI-only data which is not persisted (saved to a file or to the undo mechanism). Node parameters: serialisation and deserialisation Your node may have parameters which need to be saved to .pcot files or saved into the undo data. To do this, PCOT needs to convert them into data which is \"JSON-serialisable\" - convertable to text in the JSON format. PCOT refers to the process of conversion into JSON-serialisable data as \"serialisation,\" even though it's really only the first step. It's just that the JSON library takes care of the rest of the process. JSON-serialisable data consists of built-in Python types: strings, numbers, lists, dicts and tuples.

(pyinstaller only) Make pyInstaller builds for Windows and Linux. Do this by going into the pyInstaller directory on the required platform and running pyinstaller file.spec . Check each build works, fixing if necessary. Note that the splash screen will have been automatically generated by the file.spec file from the VERSION.txt, so if it looks weird, check here. Make a MacOS pyInstaller build. This is more complex, and is shown below. Upload to the release repo (see below) (not done now we're not using PyInstaller) Upload the docs to the documentation site.

Values are triplets of: a 32-bit floating point nominal value (i.e. a mean), a 32-bit floating point uncertainty value (as standard deviation) around that mean, and a set of 16 data quality (DQ) bits. These are usually scalar, but 1D vectors can also be created. As a user of PCOT you may never encounter Values, but they are used internally whenever any operations involving uncertainty are done. Here are the typical situations where that occurs: Binary and unary operations on Value objects This is the \"base case\". Values have dunder methods for operations. These are usually quite simple, although some (such as exponentiation) are nasty. They: perform the operation to get the new nominal value. This is usually done with a lambda function, relying on Numpy's broadcasting to do the \"right thing\" with what it's given. call a function to calculate the new uncertainty value call a function to combine the two DQs pass the three results into Value's constructor to get a new value Examples - the multiplication operator: def __mul__(self, other): return Value(self.n * other.n, mul_unc(self.n, self.u, other.n, other.u), combineDQs(self, other)) The AND operator: def __and__(self, other): \"\"\"The & operator actually finds the minimum (Zadeh fuzzy op)\"\"\" n = np.where(self.n > other.n, other.n, self.n) u = np.where(self.n > other.n, other.u, self.u) d = np.where(self.n > other.n, other.dq, self.dq) return Value(n, u, d) Binary and unary operations on Datum objects This is for binops - unary operations are much the same, but a lot simpler (although imageUnop currently takes the underlying numpy array). Datum dunder function runs - this is usually very simple. For example, for addition it's just return ops.binop(ops.Operator.ADD, self, other) . Calls pcot.expressions.ops.binop with the appopriate ops.Operator code ops.binop runs converting any raw numbers to Datum.NUMBER data with zero uncertainty. Each possible triple (operator, leftdatum, rightdatum) of operator and Datum types will have a \"binop semantics Datum wrapper\" method registered for it by ops.initOps. For example, (multiplication, Datum.IMG, Datum.NUMBER) will call ops.imageNumberBinop with the lambda lambda x,y: x*y where the latter will take and return Value. ops.binop calls the binop semantics method for the two Datum types For pairings of numbers and/or images, The binop semantics Datum wrapper converts any image data into a Value after performing subimage extraction, then calls the provided lambda. This calls the appropriate dunder method on the two Values. In fact, we could replace lambda x,y: x*y with Value.__mul__ etc., but it's much clearer this way. see above for details of this. In imageNumberBinop (or equivalent) the returned array Value will be stitched back into the left-hand image using ImageCube.modifyWithSub , and that new image will be returned wrapped in a Datum. If the semantic wrapper was numberBinop, so that a number is returned, we just wrap that in a Datum. For other types - not Datum.NUMBER or Datum.IMG - other semantics methods will have been written. For example, the ROI types have binary operators which construct ROIBinop objects using dunder methods: def regROIBinopSemantics(op, fn): \"\"\"Used to register binops for ROIs, which support a subset of ops.\"\"\" registerBinopSemantics(op, Datum.ROI, Datum.ROI, lambda dx, dy: ROIBinop(dx, dy, fn)) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.ADD, lambda x, y: x + y) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.SUB, lambda x, y: x - y) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.MUL, lambda x, y: x * y) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.DIV, lambda x, y: x / y) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.POW, lambda x, y: x ** y) Binary and unary operations in an expr node pcot.expressions.parse.InstOp runs, popping two Datum objects and calling a callback function stored in binopRegistry. This callback will have been registered by Parser.registerBinop, and is simply a lambda calling pcot.expressions.ops.binop with an Operator code for the operator, e.g. p.registerBinop('*', 20, lambda a, b: binop(Operator.MUL, a, b)) (20 is the precedence) The callback will call ops.binop, which is step 3 in the preceding section. Again, unary operations are very similar but rather simpler. functions of Value objects Value generally has a method for each supported function. For example, the tan method will perform the trigonometric tan with uncertainty, returning a new Value. This is rarely called directly - instead, we generally work with Datum objects. datumfuncs: functions of Datum objects These are registered with the @datumfunc operator (see the plugins documentation ) which can be found in pcot.expressions.register. This registers two separate wrappers: the expression wrapper, used when the function is called from an expr node; and the Python function wrapper, called when the function is called from inside Python. They can take any number of arguments, but they must be either Datum objects or numeric. Datumfuncs called from Python The @datumfunc decorator will have wrapped the function in the Python decorator, so that subsequent calls from Python will go through the wrapper. This wrapper will set default values for missing arguments (which must be string or numeric) convert numeric and string arguments to Datum objects call the original function and return the result (which must be Datum) Datumfuncs called from expr nodes The @datumfunc decorator also wraps the function in another wrapper - the exprwrapper - and registers the wrapped function with the expression parser. The wrapper itself is simpler than the Python wrapper because it can make use of facilities in the parser to convert values and check for errors. When data reaches the exprwrapper, we already know that the arguments are all Datum objects. Datumfuncs of single numeric/scalar arguments Functions of a single numeric or image Datum are sometimes written using an \"inner wrapper\", which will turn imagecubes and numbers into Value objects in a similar way to how the semantic binop wrappers work for operations. It will also wrap the resulting Value in a Datum. An example is pcot.datumfuncs.func_wrapper . Here is the datumfunc sin in full: @datumfunc def sin(a): \"\"\" Calculate sine of an angle in radians @param a:img,number:the angle (or image in which each pixel is a single angle) \"\"\" return func_wrapper(lambda xx: xx.sin(), a) We don't need worry about whether the argument is an image or a scalar, because the func_wrapper will deal with it. However, func_wrapper can only deal with images and scalars. The stats wrapper Another datumfunc inner wrapper which can be used is stats_wrapper. This wraps a function which takes a (nominal,uncertainty,dq) tuple and returns another tuple of the same type. It does the following: If provided with a numeric value, calls the wrapped function and creates a Value from the returned data. If provided with an ImageCube, gets the subimage, splits it into bands, and calls the wrapped function on the non-BAD values in each band. The results for each band - assumed to be scalar - are converted into a vector Value with one value for each band. This lets us write the mean like this: @datumfunc def mean(val): return stats_wrapper(val, lambda n, u, d: (np.mean(n), pooled_sd(n, u), pcot.dq.NONE)) and it will work on scalar Values, vector Values and images - in the latter case, producing a vector Value. The pooled_sd function will take the nominal and uncertainty arrays and pool their variation into a single value. This is done using the method in Rudmin, J. W. (2010) \"Calculating the exact pooled variance\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1007.1012.

Datum dunder function runs - this is usually very simple. For example, for addition it's just return ops.binop(ops.Operator.ADD, self, other) . Calls pcot.expressions.ops.binop with the appopriate ops.Operator code ops.binop runs converting any raw numbers to Datum.NUMBER data with zero uncertainty. Each possible triple (operator, leftdatum, rightdatum) of operator and Datum types will have a \"binop semantics Datum wrapper\" method registered for it by ops.initOps. For example, (multiplication, Datum.IMG, Datum.NUMBER) will call ops.imageNumberBinop with the lambda lambda x,y: x*y where the latter will take and return Value. ops.binop calls the binop semantics method for the two Datum types For pairings of numbers and/or images, The binop semantics Datum wrapper converts any image data into a Value after performing subimage extraction, then calls the provided lambda. This calls the appropriate dunder method on the two Values. In fact, we could replace lambda x,y: x*y with Value.__mul__ etc., but it's much clearer this way. see above for details of this. In imageNumberBinop (or equivalent) the returned array Value will be stitched back into the left-hand image using ImageCube.modifyWithSub , and that new image will be returned wrapped in a Datum. If the semantic wrapper was numberBinop, so that a number is returned, we just wrap that in a Datum. For other types - not Datum.NUMBER or Datum.IMG - other semantics methods will have been written. For example, the ROI types have binary operators which construct ROIBinop objects using dunder methods: def regROIBinopSemantics(op, fn): \"\"\"Used to register binops for ROIs, which support a subset of ops.\"\"\" registerBinopSemantics(op, Datum.ROI, Datum.ROI, lambda dx, dy: ROIBinop(dx, dy, fn)) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.ADD, lambda x, y: x + y) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.SUB, lambda x, y: x - y) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.MUL, lambda x, y: x * y) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.DIV, lambda x, y: x / y) regROIBinopSemantics(Operator.POW, lambda x, y: x ** y)","title":"Binary and unary operations on Datum objects"},{"location":"devguide/values/#binary-and-unary-operations-in-an-expr-node","text":"pcot.expressions.parse.InstOp runs, popping two Datum objects and calling a callback function stored in binopRegistry.

If provided with an ImageCube, gets the subimage, splits it into bands, and calls the wrapped function on the non-BAD values in each band.

It acts downstream from the Rover Operations Control Centre (ROCC) on images which have already been processed to some extent, and is a successor to ExoSpec 1 . As such, its primary purpose is to generate relative reflectance images and spectral parameter maps, although it will also be able to produce spectra from regions of interest. Indeed, it should be flexible enough to perform a wide range of unforeseen calculations. PCOT can also handle many other kinds of data. It is particularly suited to processing multispectral images with uncertainty and error data, and can currently read PDS4 and ENVI formats, alongside more common RGB formats which can be collated into multispectral images. Of paramount importance is the verifiability and reproducibility of data generated from PCOT. To this end, a PCOT document is a data product which can be shared between users, which also fully describes how the data was generated from the initial import to the final output. Users are encouraged to exchange PCOT documents in addition to, or instead of, the generated images or data. The Graph To achieve this, a PCOT document manipulates data in a graph - a network of nodes, each of which takes some data, works on it, perhaps displays some data, and perhaps outputs derived data. Technically speaking, this is a \"directed acyclic graph\": each connection has a direction, going from the output of one node to the input of another, and there can't be any loops. As an example, consider that we might want to overlay some kind of spectral parameter map, converted to a colour gradient, over an RGB image (note: I'm not a geologist, I'm a software engineer, so perhaps this is a very artificial example). One way to do it might be this: Figure: An example graph. Click on image to expand. We can see the graph in the panel on the right, showing each node as a box with connections to other nodes (ignore the green numbers, they just show how many times each node has run - it's a debugging aid!) The colours on the input connectors at the top and the output connectors at the bottom show the types of the values accepted and produced by those connectors, as shown on this page . Here's what each node in the graph is doing: The input 0 node reads input number 0 into the graph. The inputs are set up separately from the graph, and can be multispectral images or other data (e.g. housekeeping) from outside PCOT. The rect node lets the user draw a rectangle on the image to define a region of interest. Images can have many regions of interest and several different kinds are available. The node with 4 inputs a,b,c,d is an expr node, which calculates the result of a mathematical expression performed on each pixel. The node is showing the expression it is running: a$671 / a$438 . This will read the bands whose wavelengths are 671nm and 438nm in the node's a input, and find their ratio for every pixel. The result will be a single-band image. Expr nodes can perform much more complex calculations than this. The gradient node will convert a single-band image into an RGB image with a user-defined gradient and inset it into the RGB representation of another image - here we are insetting into the input image, using the RGB representation used by that node. Here is another example, showing a spectral plot: The input node again brings a multispectral image into the graph. The multidot node adds a number of small, circular regions of interest. Each has a different name and colour, in this case set automatically to just numbers and random colours. Creating the regions is as easy as clicking on the image. The spectrum node plots a spectrogram of the regions present in the image for all the wavelengths in that image. Figure: Spectrogram example. Click on image to expand. Here I have \"undocked\" the spectrum node's view to be a separate window for easy viewing. The spectrum can also be saved as a PDF or converted into CSV data. I'm also showing the entire app, including the menu bar and four input buttons. The Document A PCOT document is a file which can be shared among users. It consists of The inputs - data loaded from sources external to PCOT. These are kept separate from the graph, because you might want to use a different graph on the same inputs, or the load the same inputs into a different graph. There are currently up to four inputs, but this can easily be changed. The graph - a set of nodes and connections between them which define operations to be performed on inputs, as shown above. The settings - these are global to the entire application. Macros - these are sets of nodes which can be used multiple times and appear as single nodes in the graph, although each one has its own \"private\" graph. Currently very experimental (and largely undocumented). Important The data being sent out of the inputs into the graph is saved and loaded with the document, so the original source data does not need to be stored - you can send the document to someone and it will still work even if they don't have the sources. Quantities All numerical quantities in PCOT - whether scalar values or pixels in images - consist of three values: nominal value, uncertainty and data quality (DQ) bits. Uncertainty and DQ bitss can be viewed as overlays in the canvas (PCOT's image viewer component). Uncertainty The uncertainty is expressed as standard deviation, and is propagated through most operations. Be careful here, however - all values are assumed to be independent. This can lead to grossly incorrect results . For example, we could set up a graph consisting of a node with the value 0\\pm1 0\\pm1 , feed it into a mathematical expression ( expr ) node as variable *a), and set the node's expression to a-a a-a : Figure: Incorrect uncertainty calculation. Click on image to expand. The result, 0\\pm\\sqrt{2} 0\\pm\\sqrt{2} , is a consequence of the subtraction assuming that all quantities are independent even when they are clearly the same quantity. Data quality bits Each pixel in an image has a set of bits describing its quality in the source data, which are propagated through all operations. Additionally, other DQ bits may be added as the data moves through the graph - for example, division by zero may occur, or an operation whose result is undefined for those values. While DQ bits are flexible, the following are probably stable: Bit Meaning NODATA no data present (typically for a particular pixel) NOUNCERTAINTY Pixel has no uncertainty (again typically for pixels) SAT Data is saturated DIVZERO A division by zero has occurred UNDEF Result of operation is undefined COMPLEX Data is real part of complex result ERROR Unspecified error There may also be user-defined or \"test\" bits for use in development.

Install Anaconda The first thing you will need to do is install Anaconda, which can be done from here: Windows: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ Linux: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/ MacOS: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/ (untested) Obtain the software This can be done by either downloading the archive from Github and extracting it into a new directory, or cloning the repository. In both cases, the top level directory should be called PCOT (this isn't really mandatory but makes the instructions below simpler). The best way to download is this: Open an Anaconda shell window (see below) If you have an SSH key set up for GitHub, type this command into the shell ( changing the repository address if it is different ): git clone git@github.com:AU-ExoMars/PCOT.git Otherwise type this: git clone https://github.com/AU-ExoMars/PCOT.git You should now have a PCOT directory which will contain this file (as README.md) and quite a few others. Opening Anaconda's shell on different OSs Windows: Open the Anaconda Powershell Prompt application, which will have been installed when you installed Anaconda. This can be found in the Start menu under Anaconda3, or in the applications list in Anaconda Navigator (which is also in the Start menu in the same place).

There is also a video guide - it may be a little out of date, because development is progressing quickly but the basics will be the same. In this document, text written with a highlight like this is an instruction to follow. Be aware that this is an early version and there are no doubt a lot of serious problems! Also, the software is changing very quickly, so it may not look exactly as it does in these pages. Preparation PCOT is primarily designed to work with multispectral images. For this tutorial we have prepared an image and packaged it with the rest of the system, but you will need to uncompress it: it's an ENVI image and these can be rather large. It can be found in the exampleData directory as obj4-sand-subset.zip . Uncompress this image somewhere (perhaps into the same directory) producing two files: 1.hdr (the header file) and 1.dat (the data itself). This is a 256x256 image with taken using AUPE (Aberystwyth University Pancam Emulator), with 11 bands of data. It is a subset of a larger image used in testing, and is shown below as an RGB image: Figure: The example image (640nm, 550nm and 440nm bands). Click on image to expand. Now you have this image you can start PCOT . Setting up the camera directory Your data may come from a number of different cameras, and different cameras have different parameters and filter sets. PCOT needs to be able to find the files which describe these cameras. It does this when it starts up. When it can't find these files, PCOT will pop up a dialog box asking if you want to set a camera directory. You should select either the camera directory provided by your team, or the default camera directory - this will be the cameras directory inside the main PCOT directory. More cameras can be downloaded from the PCOT Cookbook site , which also contains useful \"recipes\" for doing common operations. Introduction to the user interface The image below shows the PCOT interface when the program has just been started, with text in red describing each part. Figure: The PCOT user interface. Click on image to expand. The window is divided into several areas: At the top, the input buttons each open one of PCOT's input windows. These describe how information is read into PCOT. Below this and to the left is the node area , which will be empty on startup. Double-clicking on a node in the graph (see below) will open a detailed view for that node. You can have several views open in this area looking at different nodes, and you can undock by double-clicking on the tab at the top of the view. To the right of the node area is the graph . This shows the nodes in the document and their connections. A new document always has an input 0 node, which brings input 0 into the graph. To the right of the graph is the palette , which consists of a number of sections which can be expanded or hidden. Each section a set of buttons, one for each node type. Drag a button onto the graph to create a new node of that type. At the bottom is the log area , the status bar , and a set of global controls . Working with graph nodes Each node is shown as a box with input connections on the top and output connections on the bottom. To illustrate this, consider the following graph you've seen before: Figure: R671_438 inset into source image RGB representation. Click on image to expand. Node boxes Looking at a pair of nodes in the graph: Figure: A pair of nodes. Click on image to expand. The inputs and outputs are coloured by type: blue is perhaps the most common and indicates an image. Red means any kind of data can be connected here, and generally only appears on inputs. Inputs and outputs can also have names (but don't always). Each node has a help box - double-clicking on this pops up help for the node. Each node has a name - usually this is the node's type, but in the case of the expr node it is the expression being calculated (see below). Nodes can have a \"display text\" in blue. These show extra data, such as the output of a calculation in an expr node or the annotation given to a region of interest. Currently nodes without a display text also show the number of times they have been calculated as a debugging aid. Creating new nodes This is done by clicking a node type button in the palette and dragging the button onto the graph. Selecting and opening graph nodes You can select a node in the graph by clicking on it, or by dragging a box which intersects the node. A selected node will be tinted blue. You can open a node for viewing or editing in the node area by double-clicking. If you double-click on the input 0 node, it will turn a dark cyan colour and a view of the node will appear on the left, along with a tab to select that view when multiple node views are open. You can close an open node by clicking on the cross in the node's tab. If you open the input 0 node in a new document you will see this: Figure: PCOT with an open but unused input node. Click on image to expand. The node is cyan because the current view's node is tinted green, and the node is already tinted blue because it is selected in the graph. There are two selection models: Multiple nodes can be selected in the graph; these are tinted blue. A single node's view can be open and currently being edited, this node is tinted green in the graph. Nodes which are both being edited and are selected are tinted cyan. The view for this particular node - input 0 - shows what external input is currently being read into PCOT on the input numbered 0. In this case it shows \"None\" because there is currently no input. \"Undocking\" a node's view Sometimes it is useful to see several node views at the same time. Double-clicking on the tab, where the name of the node type appears, will make the view open in a separate window. This can be done for several views, and the windows can be rearranged as you wish. Closing the window will \"redock\" the view so it appears in the node area as before. Constant and comment nodes These two nodes are special - the boxes in the graph have text fields which can be edited. For constant nodes, the value in the box will be the numeric output of the node. This node has no view, and double-clicking has no effect. For comment nodes, the value in the box is a text comment that can help other users navigate the graph. Once edited, the box can be resized by clicking and dragging its bottom-right corner. The text will flow to fit the box. Double-clicking on a comment node opens a view which provides an alternative way of editing the text, as well as changing the font size and colours. It's also the only way of getting blank lines into the text, since hitting the \"enter\" key will stop editing when you are editing the node text directly in its box. Figure: Comment and constant nodes. Click on image to expand. Loading an image The purpose of the input 0 node is to bring the an input into the graph for manipulation. As noted elsewhere , the graph is separate from the inputs. This makes it easier to run different graphs on the same inputs, or the same graph on different inputs. Clicking on the \"Input 0\" button at the top of the window will open a window to let us change the input, which looks like this: Figure: An input window, with the null input selected. Click on image to expand. Each input supports a number of input methods , only one of which can be active at a time. By default, the method is null , meaning that no data is loaded into that input. PCOT can support several types of multispectral data file: we will load a small ENVI image we uncompressed earlier. Click on ENVI , and the window will show that input's ENVI method settings and select the ENVI method as being active (see below). In the ENVI input window, Click on Select Directory to open a dialog Choose the directory where you stored the 1.hdr and 1.dat files you extracted earlier Double-click on the 1.hdr file You should see something like this: Figure: An open ENVI input. Click on image to expand. The Canvas The right-hand side is a common component in PCOT known as a canvas which will show the image selected. The canvas lets you modify how the RGB channels are mapped using the three combo boxes. Each box gives the band number, the input number and the wavelength. For example, the red channel is coming from band 2, which is from input 0, and has a wavelength of 640nm. If the RGB method is used to load an ordinary RGB image (e.g. from a PNG), the wavelength will not be shown. At the bottom of the image itself are three source indicators : these show what bands within which inputs were used to generate the canvas image. They should show something like [0:640][0:540][0:480] indicating that the red, green and blue channels come from the 640nm, 540nm and 480nm bands in input 0's image. The source indicator may get quite complex - it shows all inputs that have had an effect on each channel of the image. The indicators may be different because the source display is currently under development. The canvas is quite complicated because it does a lot of things, such as displaying spectra for each pixel, normalisation settings, and displaying data quality bits. More information can be found here , but for now: Click the spectrum button to open a spectrum view, and move the cursor over the image to show the spectrum at different pixels. You may need to resize the window, or drag the \"double bar\" which separates the image from the spectrum. Manipulating an image: obtaining a spectral parameter map Let's perform a simple manipulation on an image. Here we will generate a spectral parameter map from two of the image bands. This parameter is R671_438 , the ratio between the 671nm and 438nm bands, which indicates the presence of ferric minerals 1 . Start PCOT and load an image into input 0 as before , by clicking on the Input 0 button, selecting RGB and double-clicking on an image file. Double-click on the input 0 node in the graph - instances of this node bring input 0 into the graph. Open the maths section in the palette by clicking on it. Drag expr in the maths section onto the graph to create an expression evaluation node. Drag a connection from the output of input 0 to the a input of expr . Double-click on the expr node to open its view for editing - this will show an empty output because our mathematical expression is empty. We now have an input feeding into an expression evaluator, which we can edit. First, let's just see one band. Click in the expr view's expression box : this is the box which says \"Enter expression here...\". Enter the string a$671 This says \"select the band with centre wavelength 671nm from input a \". Press \"Run\" in the node's view . You should now see a monochrome image in the node's canvas: the result of the calculation, containing only that single band. Now change the expression to a$671/a$438 and press \"Run\" to see the result, which should be this: Figure: R671_438 parameter from an multispectral image. Click on image to expand. Note that the source indicators in the bottom left of the image are now displaying [0:438&0:671] [0:438&0:671] [0:438&0:671] This indicates that all three RGB channels shown in the canvas are getting their data from the 438 and 671 bands of input 0. Disconnecting nodes and node error states Disconnect the input node by dragging the arrowhead from the a box and releasing it in empty space. This will cause an error: Figure: A node in an error state. Click on image to expand. The EXPR is the kind of error - EXPR is an error in expression parsing/execution. More details can be seen in the log window, which in this case reads Error in expression: variable's input is not connected This is because there is no longer an image feeding into the expr node's input for variable a . Now reconnect the input node to the expr node to fix the error. Adding a region of interest It's a little hard to see what's going on, so we will add a region of interest. This will make the expr node treat the operation differently - only the area inside the rectangle will be norm(a$671/a$438) . Everywhere else in the image, the output will come from the left-hand side of the expression (the 671nm channel). The rules for ROIs are explained more fully on this page . Open the regions section of the palette and add a rect node between the input and expr nodes (the latter of which will be labelled with its expression). Nothing will change, because the rectangle has not been set. Edit the rect node and draw a rectangle by clicking and dragging on the canvas. Set the scale to 5 pixels and type \"671_438\" in the Annotation box , something like this: Figure: R671_438 with a rectangle. Click on image to expand. Now the expr node shows this - only the rectangle has the 671/438 parameter, while the rest of the image shows the 671nm band. To see this, click on the expr tab : Figure: R671_438 with a rectangle. Click on image to expand. The image is dark, because the values of the parameter shown in the rectangle are much greater than those of the 671nm band. It can be hard to adjust the rectangle when you can't see what's happening in the final image - try undocking the rect node and dragging it to a different part of the screen by double-clicking on the tab, so you can edit the rectangle while the expr output is visible. Dock it again by closing the undocked window . To make things more visible still, open the data section and add a gradient node after the expr node and view it , clicking making sure Show ROIs is enabled on its canvas (ROIs are typically retained on derived images): Figure: R671_438 with a rectangle and gradient. Click on image to expand. There's not much to see because of the nature of the image, unfortunately! Note that there is a \"legend\" at top left, and this can be edited and placed by clicking on the Legend button : Figure: R671_438 with a better gradient legend. Click on image to expand. The colour palette for the gradient, incidentally, is the \"viridis\" palette which is helpful for people with certain kinds of colour blindness 2 . Other presets are available by clicking on the Load Preset button, or you can edit the gradient by hand: double-click to add or remove a point, drag to move a point. It is possible to \"inset\" the gradient into the RGB representation used in the input node by passing that to the insetinto input of the gradient: Figure: R671_438 inset into source image RGB representation. Click on image to expand. If you switch to the Legend part of the gradient node and select Left margin for the Legend item , when you export the image with the canvas' Export Image button the legend will be in the margin: Figure: Exported R671_438 (svg).

The canvas lets you modify how the RGB channels are mapped using the three combo boxes. Each box gives the band number, the input number and the wavelength. For example, the red channel is coming from band 2, which is from input 0, and has a wavelength of 640nm. If the RGB method is used to load an ordinary RGB image (e.g. from a PNG), the wavelength will not be shown. At the bottom of the image itself are three source indicators : these show what bands within which inputs were used to generate the canvas image. They should show something like [0:640][0:540][0:480] indicating that the red, green and blue channels come from the 640nm, 540nm and 480nm bands in input 0's image. The source indicator may get quite complex - it shows all inputs that have had an effect on each channel of the image. The indicators may be different because the source display is currently under development. The canvas is quite complicated because it does a lot of things, such as displaying spectra for each pixel, normalisation settings, and displaying data quality bits. More information can be found here , but for now: Click the spectrum button to open a spectrum view, and move the cursor over the image to show the spectrum at different pixels.

Here we will generate a spectral parameter map from two of the image bands. This parameter is R671_438 , the ratio between the 671nm and 438nm bands, which indicates the presence of ferric minerals 1 . Start PCOT and load an image into input 0 as before , by clicking on the Input 0 button, selecting RGB and double-clicking on an image file. Double-click on the input 0 node in the graph - instances of this node bring input 0 into the graph. Open the maths section in the palette by clicking on it. Drag expr in the maths section onto the graph to create an expression evaluation node. Drag a connection from the output of input 0 to the a input of expr . Double-click on the expr node to open its view for editing - this will show an empty output because our mathematical expression is empty. We now have an input feeding into an expression evaluator, which we can edit. First, let's just see one band. Click in the expr view's expression box : this is the box which says \"Enter expression here...\". Enter the string a$671 This says \"select the band with centre wavelength 671nm from input a \". Press \"Run\" in the node's view . You should now see a monochrome image in the node's canvas: the result of the calculation, containing only that single band. Now change the expression to a$671/a$438 and press \"Run\" to see the result, which should be this: Figure: R671_438 parameter from an multispectral image. Click on image to expand. Note that the source indicators in the bottom left of the image are now displaying [0:438&0:671] [0:438&0:671] [0:438&0:671] This indicates that all three RGB channels shown in the canvas are getting their data from the 438 and 671 bands of input 0.","title":"Manipulating an image: obtaining a spectral parameter map"},{"location":"gettingstarted/tutorial/#disconnecting-nodes-and-node-error-states","text":"Disconnect the input node by dragging the arrowhead from the a box and releasing it in empty space.

Open the regions section of the palette and add a rect node between the input and expr nodes (the latter of which will be labelled with its expression). Nothing will change, because the rectangle has not been set. Edit the rect node and draw a rectangle by clicking and dragging on the canvas. Set the scale to 5 pixels and type \"671_438\" in the Annotation box , something like this: Figure: R671_438 with a rectangle. Click on image to expand.

Click on image to expand. The image is dark, because the values of the parameter shown in the rectangle are much greater than those of the 671nm band. It can be hard to adjust the rectangle when you can't see what's happening in the final image - try undocking the rect node and dragging it to a different part of the screen by double-clicking on the tab, so you can edit the rectangle while the expr output is visible.

PCOT needs to know about these, and stores them in camera data files. These are in PCOT's archive format and so have the PARC extension. When you start PCOT for the first time you will need to tell it where to find these files. PCOT will load all the camera files from the provided directory, storing them under names given in the files themselves. Obtaining camera files Initial version of the files are stored in the PCOT repository with PCOT itself, in the cameras directory. For example, a file for PANCAM can be found in PCOT/cameras/pancam.parc . Currently these files hold very little calibration data, just the filter information. You should be able to download camera files containing full data for AUPE and PanCam from the PCOT Cookbook site. Data will be added to this server when it becomes available. The rest of this page describes how to make your own data files if you are working with a new camera. Creating camera files Camera data is generated from a YAML parameter file (and possibly extra data) and stored in a PARC file. To create a camera data file, run the pcot gencam command: pcot gencam cameraname.yaml cameraname.parc Format of the YAML file The camera parameter file should have the following form at minimum: name: AUPE # short name of the camera date: 2025-03-04 # date of the camera data in YYYY-MM-DD format (ISO 8601) author: Jim Finnis <jcf12@aber.ac.uk> # author of the camera data # short description of the camera, much less than 80 chars short: The left WAC on the Aberystwyth University PanCam Emulator # longer description of the camera description: | The Aberystwyth University PANCAM Emulator This dataset represents AUPE as it was on 4th March 2025. # Filters organised thus: filters: C01L: # filter name cwl: 640 # centre wavelength fwhm: 100 # full-width at half-maximum position: L03 # position in camera (e.g. L03 for left wheel, number 3) transmission: 1.0 # transmission ratio description: \"Red broadband\" # short phrase describing the filter C02L: cwl: 540 fwhm: 80 position: L02 transmission: 1.0 description: \"Green broadband\" (and so on) Flatfield data The gencam command will build flatfield data from a large number of images captured for each filter. These images should be stored in a directory for each filter, named for the filter name. For example: filters |-- C01L | |-- 001.png | |-- 002.png | |-- 003.png | |-- 004.png | `-- 005.png `-- C02L |-- 001.png |-- 002.png |-- 003.png |-- 004.png `-- 005.png The name of the directory should be the name or position of the filter according to the filters section of the file. Which is used depends on the key field (see below). The number and names of the files within the directories is unimportant, but they must be monochrome images of the same format and size. The files are processed as follows: All files are loaded in and processed into floating point data in the range [0,1] [0,1] . The files are scanned for saturated data (data equal to 1) and these pixels are masked out. The mean is found of each pixel, disregarding saturated pixels, and the results stored in a single image. The uncertainty is calculated as the std. dev. of the pixels used. If all bits for a pixel were saturated, the DQ SAT bit for that pixel is set and its value is set to zero. The result is not divided by the mean or processed further in any way - later this may be done when darkfields are implemented, but this can be done downstream for the moment. For flats to be included the YAML file should contain a flats section like this: flats: # enabled: yes # uncomment this line to avoid saving flatfield data (to save space) directory: foo/filters # the path to the directory, e.g. \"filters\" in example above extension: png # extension of image files (png or bin) bitdepth: 10 # how many bits are used in the data - this is 16bit data but only # the lower 10 bits are used - data will be multiplied up key: name # \"name\" or \"position\" - the filter directories can be named for either If you are creating the data from raw files - and this is typically the case - you will need to specify how those files should be loaded. This can be done with the rawloader subsection, which consists of a full specification for the raw loader (recommended) or a preset. You do not need to specify a preset if PNGs are used. To specify the raw loader fully use the following format: flats: directory: flats key: position # the subdirectories are named for the filter position extension: bin # loading raw files bitdepth: 10 rawloader: # u16, 1024x1024, 48-bit offset, bigendian, rotate 90 CCW # preset: pancamraw format: u16 # 16-bit unsigned integer data; others are f32, u8 width: 1024 height: 1024 bigendian: true offset: 48 # offset in bytes to the start of the data rot: 90 # rotate the data 90 degrees counter-clockwise horzflip: false # horizontal flip? No. vertflip: false # vertical flip? No. To use a preset instead, you can use the following format: flats: # ... other fields as above rawloader: preset: pancam-rawloader # use this multifile preset for loading PANCAM files where the preset has been created in the multifile input. However, It's best to specify the data fully rather than risk another user not having the preset when trying to reconstruct the data. See the multifile docs for more details on presets for loading binary files. Remapping filter names in flatfield data Sometimes the directory names are not the same as the filter names or positions. In this case you can use a directory_map dictionary inside the flats section, like this: flats: # ... other fields as above directory_map: # Each key below is a filter position, the value is the directory in which to find that filter. \"01\": \"01\" \"02\": \"02\" \"03\": \"some_other_dir\" # e.g. if filter 03 is in a different directory \"04\": \"yet_another_dir\" # e.g. if filter 04 is in a different directory # ... and so on. Note that every filter position must be listed in the directory_map dictionary, even if the value is the same as the key. Reflectance data This section is likely to change in the future as reflectance data becomes more complex! You can store the reflectance data for each filter in the camera data file for a given calibration target. To do this, you need to add a reflectance section to the YAML file, like this: reflectance: # PCT Colourimetry data from this directory: # ABU-Exomars - Colourimetry\\2023-11-21_colour_targets\\pct\\*-full-br\\*BS* images PCT: lwac_from_colourimetry_pct.csv # reflectance data from the Babelcolour ColourChecker dataset # https://babelcolor.com/colorchecker-2.htm#CCP2_data macbeth: lwac_from_babelcolour_colorchecker.csv The CSV files contain the reflectance per filter for each patch in the target, with the following columns: ROI : (region of interest) the name of the patch in the target filter : the name of the filter n : the mean of the reflectance for that patch in that filter u : the uncertainty in the reflectance for that patch in that filter Here are the first few lines of the lwac_from_colourimetry_pct.csv file: ROI,filter,n,u NG4,C03L,0.07009,0.0052 NG4,C02L,0.07165,0.00442 NG4,C01L,0.07126,0.00565 NG4,G0a,0.07174,0.0043 NG4,G0b,0.06581,0.00508 NG4,G0c,0.07276,0.00456 ... Listing camera data using PCOT You can find out which cameras are available and what data they have using the lscams subcommand: pcot lscams The basic command will just list the cameras, the filename they are stored in, and their short description. Given a camera name, it will only give data for that camera. There are more options: -f will list the filters -l (long) will list the full description of the camera and whether it has flats and reflectance data -F (file) will take a camera data filename rather than a camera name For example, to show filters and full details for AUPE_LEFT we could run pcot lscams -fl AUPE_LEFT Further work Later, more information will be added to the camera data files: Extra data (darkfields, BRDF data etc) Extra filter fields (aberration, etc)","title":"Camera data"},{"location":"userguide/cameradata/#camera-data","text":"Each camera used with PCOT has different filters and other associated data.

Constant scalars can also be used. The node can be found in the \"maths\" section of the palette. It has four inputs and one output, and these can be of any type - the output type will be determined when the expression runs. The expr node is unusual in that the node's box in the graph will show the expression being calculated: Figure: An example of a graph showing an expr node which is running a merge function, combining the channels of two images into a single image.. Click on image to expand. In this example, two images showing slightly different views of the same scene with different bands (one visible light, one infra-red) are registered using the manual register node. They are then merged together using the merge function. The box shows this function, and also IMG[12] indicating that the result is a 12-band image. Functions Merge is one of a large number of functions that expr supports, and more can be added using the plug-in mechanism . Full details of built-in functions can be found in the autodocs Properties Certain types of value have \"properties\" which can be extracted with the dot operator. For example, a.w will extract the width of the image in variable a a , and (a+b).n will return the number of pixels in the image which results from adding images a a and b b . There aren't many properties, but those that exist are listed in the autodocs . Autodocs The text below is drawn from the automatically generated documentation for the node, and is the authoritative documentation. expr Description Expression evaluator. The node box will show the text of the expression. The \"run\" button must be clicked to set the node to the new expression and perform it. The input can accept any type of data and the output type is determined when the node is run. The four inputs are assigned to the variables a, b, c, and d. They are typically (but not necessarily) images or numeric values. The standard operators +,/,*,- and ^ all have their usual meanings. When applied to images they work in a pixel-wise fashion, so if a is an image, 2*a will double the brightness. If b is also an image, a+b will add the two images, pixel by pixel. There are two non-standard operators: . for properties and $ for band extraction. These are described below. Image/numeric operators: operator description precedence (higher binds tighter) A + B add A to B (can act on ROIs) 10 A - B subtract A from B (can act on ROIs) 10 A / B divide A by B (can act on ROIs) 20 A * B multiply A by B (can act on ROIs) 20 A ^ B exponentiate A to the power B (can act on ROIs) 30 -A element-wise negation of A (can act on ROIs) 50 A.B property B of entity A (e.g. a.h is height of image a) 80 A$546 extract single band image of wavelength 546 100 A$_2 extract single band image from band 2 explicitly 100 A&B element-wise minimum of A and B (Zadeh's AND operator) 20 A|B element-wise maximum of A and B (Zadeh's OR operator) 20 !A element-wise 1-A (Zadeh's NOT operator) 50 All operators can act on images, 1D vectors and scalars with the exception of . and $ which have images on the left-hand side and identifiers or integers on the right-hand side. Those operators marked with (can act on ROIs) can also act on pairs of ROIs (regions of interest, see below). Binary operations on image pairs These act by performing the binary operation on the two underlying Numpy arrays. This means you may need to be careful about the ordering of the bands in the two images, because they will simply be operated on in the order they appear. For example, consider adding two images $a$ and $b$ with the same bands in a slightly different order: image a image b result of addition 480nm 480nm sum of 480nm bands 500nm 500nm sum of 500nm bands 610nm 670nm a 's 610nm band plus b 's 670nm band 670nm 610nm copy of previous band (addition being commutative) This probably isn't what you wanted. Note that this is obviously not an issue when an operation is being performed on bands in a single image. Binary operators on images with regions of interest If one of the two images has an ROI, the operation is only performed on that ROI; the remaining area of output is taken from the image without an ROI. If both images have an ROI an error will result - it is likely that this is a mistake on the user's part, and doing something more \"intelligent\" might conceal this. The desired result can be achieved using expr nodes on ROIs and an importroi node. Operations with vectors Some functions can generate vectors, such as mean for getting the means of the bands, and vec for generating vectors by hand. If an image is used in a binary operation with a vector on the other side, the vector must have the same number of elements as there are bands in the image. The operation will be performed on each band. Consider a 3-band image and the vector [2,3,4] . If we multiply them, the result will an image with the first band multiplied by 2, the second band multiplied by 3, and the third band multiplied by 4. Operators on ROIs themselves (as opposed to images with ROIs) operator description a+b union a*b intersection a-b difference You can source ROIs from the \"roi\" output of ROI nodes, and impose resulting ROIs on images with \"importroi\" node. Band extraction The notation $name or $wavelength takes an image on the left-hand side and extracts a single band, generating a new monochrome image. The right-hand side is either a filter name, a filter position, a wavelength or a band index preceded by \"_\". Depending on the camera, all these could be valid: expression meaning a$780 the 780nm band in image a a$_2 band 2 in the image a (a+b)$G0 the band named G0 in the image formed by adding images a and b ((a+b)/2)$780 the average of the 780nm bands of images a and b Be aware of caveats in the \"binary operations on image pairs\" section above: it may be better to extract the band before performing the operation, thus: old expression better expression (a+b)$G0 a$G0 + b$G0 ((a+b)/2)$780 (a$780+b$780)/2 Brackets Round brackets are used to group expressions as usual, but square brackets are used for indexing into a vector. For example, a[3] will extract the fourth element of the vector a . However, square brackets cannot (yet) create a vector. To do this, use the vec function - so vec(1,2,3)[1] will return 2. Band extraction can also be performed with vectors provided the vector elements are numeric (i.e. wavelengths): a $ vec(640,550,440) is valid. Properties Properties are indicated by the . operator, e.g. a.w to find an image's width. Help on functions and properties A list of functions can be obtained by right-clicking on either the log pane or function entry pane and selecting \"List all functions.\" Help on an individual function can be found by hovering over the name of a function, right-clicking and selecting \"Get help on 'somefunction'\". Similar actions are supported for properties. Uncertainties are assumed to be independent in all binary operations While uncertainty is propagated through operations (as population standard deviation) all quantities are assumed to be independent (calculating covariances is beyond the scope of this system). Be very careful here. For example, the uncertainty for the expression tan(a) will be calculated correctly, but if you try to use sin(a)/cos(a) the uncertainty will be incorrect because the nominator and denominator are not independent.

The regex aspect of multifile is complicated, so documenting it was a priority. The multifile input method allows multiple monochrome files of \"standard\" types like PNG and BMP to be imported as multispectral images. It can also read raw binary files. Each file is flattened to greyscale in the process (if it is RGB) by finding the mean of the three channels for each pixel. Camera data files In order to analyse the images, PCOT needs to be able to find out which filter was used for each image and get information about it. It also needs access to calibration information, for example flat and dark field images, and reflectance data. This data is stored in PARC files - PCOT archives - and is generated by the pcot gencam command. If you want to know to make them yourself, read this documentation . However, PCOT already comes with some camera files. These can be found in the cameras directory inside the PCOT directory. They do not have flat/dark fields because that data is very large, but hopefully you will not need them - that stage of processing will take place upstream in the ROC. Other camera data files can be downloaded from the PCOT Cookbook . Setting a camera Once you know what camera was used, and you have installed a data file for that camera, you can set it in the multifile input using the Camera widget. Which image is which filter? Setting a file pattern The multifile input method lets you specify a camera, but PCOT still needs to be able to work out which filter was used to capture each band in the image. This is done by extracting the filter name or position from the filename using a regular expression (or regex ). If you have some experience with regular expressions (or access to someone with this experience), it will help immensely . Regular expressions describe patterns which texts might match. For example, the regex c[a-z]t will match any three-letter string starting with c and ending with t : it's c , followed by any character between a and z , followed by t . Beginner's guide Useful 'playground' to try out expressions The default pattern looks something like this: .*[LR]WAC(?P<pos>[0-9][0-9]).* This means: .* matches any number of any character, so there could be anything at the start of the filename. [LR] means \"either L or R \". WAC means we must then have the sequence of letters WAC (?P<pos>[0-9][0-9]) means we must now match two digits ( [0-9] ). We've put them in brackets and preceded them with ?P<pos> which means we should store the result under the name pos . The final .* means that there can now be any number of any character again - so there could be anything at the end of the filename. The idea is that a filename like /home/jim/files/DogBiscuitLWAC02Fish.jpg will be matched, and will result in 02 being stored as pos , which will then be used to look up the filter. You can set the default pattern from the command line with pcot setconfig Default.multifile_pattern \"your pattern here\" Named matches and how they are used Only one of the following should be true (e.g. you can't use name and n together): lens and n : if these are found, they are joined together to form a filter position which is looked up in the filter set (by the position column). The idea is that lens indicates either the left or right camera and n identifies a filter. They're separate because many early files used names like LWAC02 or LWideAngle02 , in which the two elements were separate. pos : if this is found, it us used to match a filter position using the pos column - as such, it's a simpler version of the lens / n combination name : if this is found, it is used to match a filter using the name column cwl : if this is found, it is used to match a filter using the cwl (wavelength) column If you need assistance, or this isn't flexible enough, contact us - or maybe use the assignfilters node. An alternative: assignfilters You can assign filters in a camera to bands in an image manually using the assignfilters node (in the \"utility\" group). This is fairly self-explanatory: feed in an image, select a camera, and assign the bands using the move up and down buttons. Reading raw binary files Data is often provided \"as is\" from the camera, in a raw binary format. Reading these files requires a little more information in advance: What the numeric format of the data is (e.g. 16-bit unsigned integer) How big the image is in pixels Whether there is a header at the start which should be skipped and how big it is (the \"offset\") Whether the image needs to be rotated and/or flipped Whether the data is \"big-endian\" or \"little-endian.\" These can be set by clicking the \"raw loader settings\" dialog. For images from AUPE, the settings are: 16-bit unsigned integer 1024x1024 48 byte offset Rotate 90 degrees Big-endian data Presets You can save and load these values - and most other settings for multifile input, such as the pattern and filter - using the \"Presets\" button.

For example, the regex c[a-z]t will match any three-letter string starting with c and ending with t : it's c , followed by any character between a and z , followed by t . Beginner's guide Useful 'playground' to try out expressions The default pattern looks something like this: .*[LR]WAC(?P<pos>[0-9][0-9]).* This means: .* matches any number of any character, so there could be anything at the start of the filename. [LR] means \"either L or R \". WAC means we must then have the sequence of letters WAC (?P<pos>[0-9][0-9]) means we must now match two digits ( [0-9] ). We've put them in brackets and preceded them with ?P<pos> which means we should store the result under the name pos . The final .* means that there can now be any number of any character again - so there could be anything at the end of the filename. The idea is that a filename like /home/jim/files/DogBiscuitLWAC02Fish.jpg will be matched, and will result in 02 being stored as pos , which will then be used to look up the filter.

This page describes these rules, most of which apply to image data. Source handling rules Each datum handled by PCOT has a \"source set\" describing where that datum ultimately comes from. Sources vary: in images, each band in an input image carries a source datum describing where it comes from. For a PDS4 source it could be a LIDVID, or it could simply be a filename (although ideally it should have some archive indexing data). Because data can be combined in various ways, each datum could have multiple sources. Image data in PCOT have a separate source set for each band. The rules for sources are simple: Every datum has a source set. This may be a null source if the datum is generated internally (consider the output from constant nodes). In the case of an image, this source set is actually a separate source set for each band, but may still be considered as a single source set for some operations (since the union of the band sets is available). If a datum, or band in a multi-band image, is constructed from data from more than once source set, the resulting datum or band consists of the union of the sets. As an example, consider the rather contrived example below. Here, each datum is marked as a black circle below which is a description of the the sources - there's more explanation of this below. image inputs are in yellow scalar inputs are in blue nodes are white rectangles expr nodes (which calculate mathematical expressions) are marked as such with the expression being the main text Figure: An example graph.. Click on image to expand. We have three inputs into the graph: Input 0 has an image with three bands centered on 640nm, 540nm and 440nm. Input 1 has a different image with four bands. Input 2 has a numeric value of 0.2 (perhaps a housekeeping datum of some kind). These data are then combined in various ways: Input 1 is converted to a single greyscale band and multiplied by input 2 (the scalar 0.2) The result of this operation is then added to the 540nm band of input 0. What do the sources look like for each datum? Datum A is an image, and as such it has one source set per band. Each source set consists of a single source, with details of input and filter wavelength. So here, the sources for A could be written as [ {0:640}, {0:540}, {0:440} ] That is, a list of three sets, each of which contains a single source which I've written in the form input:wavelength . Datum B is the extracted 540nm band of input A, so its sources are: [ {0:540} ] Datum C is another multiband image, this time from input 1: [ {1:780}, {1:640}, {1:540}, {1:440} ] Datum D is the greyscale conversion of Datum C above. This creates a single-band image, but that band combines all the bands of datum C. This results in a single source set containing all the bands: [ {1:780, 1:640, 1:540, 1:440} ] Datum E is the only non-image source. I will denote it here as just \"2\" indicating that it is input 2. It is worth noting here that sources may contain a lot of extra data describing exactly where they come from. For example, this input may come from PDS4, in which case at least the LIDVID will be included. But for now this is simply {2} Note that this is not shown as a list because it is not a multiband source. Datum F multiplies each band in datum D by the scalar E. This means that the source for E must be added to the source set for each band. There is only one band at this point because of the greyscale conversion: [ {1:780, 1:640, 1:540, 1:440, 2} ] Finally, we add the single-band images B and F together, resulting in another single-band image. This addition is done bandwise. There is only one band, so the result is: [ {1:780, 1:640, 1:540, 1:440, 2, 0:540} ] ROI rules Images may contain regions of interest. If this is the case, then any operation should only be performed on the region of interest if possible. However, the rest of the image should be passed through unchanged to provide context - it is always possible to use a croproi node before the operation if cropping is required. This rule has the following practical outcomes, in which images are denoted by capitals A, B, \\dots A, B, \\dots and scalars are denoted by lowercase x, y. \\dots x, y. \\dots So: In binary operations on an image and a scalar such as x+A x+A or A+x A+x , the operation is only performed on the region covered by the union of all ROIs on A A . Other parts of A A are left unchanged in the output, which carries the same ROIs. In binary operations on two images A+B A+B etc., there should be only one set of ROIs in operation. This means that either only one image has an ROI, or the sets of ROIs for both images are identical. Outside the ROI, the image pixels are taken from the left-hand side of the operator as shown in the figure below. Figure: Two images A and B, B has an ROI. In the result, the area covered by the ROI is A+B, the rest of the image is passed through from A (which has no ROI). Click on image to expand. Originally the rule was that the intersection of the unions of the ROIs would be processed, while the rest of the output would be from the left-hand side (in the case of image data). That was too complicated, and broke the \"principle of least astonishment.\" If the user has put different ROIs on both sides of their image they have probably made a mistake. However, it's quite possible for the same ROIs to be on both sides of an expression if they were derived from the same image. Quality data All values in PCOT - scalar and image - can have an uncertainty value and data quality (DQ) bits. In imagecubes, this applies to every pixel of every band. The uncertainty values are expressed as standard deviations. Operations need to combine these data in a sensible way. Note that the standard deviation used is the population standard deviation, not the sample standard deviation. This is currently implemented using the Value class. Consists of: image uncertainty map (float per band) image quality/info bits (uint16 per band) Uncertainty Uncertainty values are propagated through calculations in the expr node and elsewhere according to these rules: \\begin{align} \\sigma(a+b), \\quad \\sigma(a-b) &= \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 a + \\sigma^2 b}\\\\ \\sigma(ab) &= |ab| \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma a}{a}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma b}{b}\\right)^2} \\\\ &= \\sqrt{a^2 \\sigma^2 b + b^2 \\sigma^2 a}\\quad \\text{when all values positive}\\\\ \\sigma(a/b) &= \\left|\\frac{a}{b}\\right| \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma a}{a}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma b}{b}\\right)^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 \\sigma^2 b + b^2 \\sigma^2 a}}{b^2}\\quad \\text{when all values positive}\\\\ \\sigma(a^b) &= \\sqrt{ (a^{b-1} b \\sigma a)^2 + (a^b \\log a \\sigma b)^2} \\\\ &= \\sqrt{a^{2b-2} ((a \\sigma b \\log a)^2 + (b \\sigma a)^2)}\\\\ \\sigma (a \\& b) &= \\min (\\sigma a, \\sigma b)\\\\ \\sigma (a | b) &= \\max (\\sigma a, \\sigma b) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\sigma(a+b), \\quad \\sigma(a-b) &= \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 a + \\sigma^2 b}\\\\ \\sigma(ab) &= |ab| \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma a}{a}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma b}{b}\\right)^2} \\\\ &= \\sqrt{a^2 \\sigma^2 b + b^2 \\sigma^2 a}\\quad \\text{when all values positive}\\\\ \\sigma(a/b) &= \\left|\\frac{a}{b}\\right| \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma a}{a}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma b}{b}\\right)^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 \\sigma^2 b + b^2 \\sigma^2 a}}{b^2}\\quad \\text{when all values positive}\\\\ \\sigma(a^b) &= \\sqrt{ (a^{b-1} b \\sigma a)^2 + (a^b \\log a \\sigma b)^2} \\\\ &= \\sqrt{a^{2b-2} ((a \\sigma b \\log a)^2 + (b \\sigma a)^2)}\\\\ \\sigma (a \\& b) &= \\min (\\sigma a, \\sigma b)\\\\ \\sigma (a | b) &= \\max (\\sigma a, \\sigma b) \\end{align} Remember that generally these rules only apply if the bands are independent. In reality there is always a covariance between them, but we have to ignore that. Not all images contain uncertainty data - it may be that the input image doesn't have this data, or that a function has been performed on the image which does not permit uncertainty data to be carried through (consider a decorrelation stretch, for example). This can be viewed by selecting the nounc (no uncertainty) bit for viewing in the canvas . DQ bits Each scalar, or band value for each pixel, has an associated set of bits which indicate error states, etc. Bits are currently: Bit name Meaning Effect on calculations (see notes below) NODATA There is no data here BAD SAT Pixel is saturated high in this band BAD DIVZERO The data is the result of a division by zero BAD UNDEF The data is the result of an undefined operation BAD COMPLEX The data is a complex number likely to be undefined (or just the real part) BAD ERROR There is an unspecified error in this data BAD ZERO This data is zero NOUNCERTAINTY There is no uncertainty data All bits are propagated into the data generated from the data they are attached to. BAD means that the data in these pixels should not be considered. While calculations will still be done on BAD data, the BAD bits will be propagated. In the case of nodes which generate a scalar from images, such as finding the mean or SD of a set of pixels (or similar operations in the spectrum node) the pixels marked BAD should be ignored. It is possible to set bits based on per-pixel conditions with the dqmod node. For example, convert all uncertainties greater than a given value into errors. It is possible to convert DQ bits into regions of interest using the roidq node, with the region being made up of pixels for which certain bits are absent or present. This can be done looking at all bands or just one. In general, when multiple image bands are combined (either from the same image or from different images) these are OR-ed together. This typically happens in a band-wise fashion because images are combined band-wise. Thus, when two images a a and b b are added, and the bits for channel i i of image a a are B_i(a) B_i(a) , \\[ B_i(a+b) = B_i(a) \\vee B_i(b)\\quad \\text{for all channels } i \\] However, some operations have a more complex flow of information. For example, a decorrelation stretch results in information from all bands being used in each band. In cases like this, the resulting bands are all ORed toether: \\[ B_i(\\text{decorr}(a)) = \\bigvee_i B_i(a) \\] UNIMPLEMENTED BIT OPERATIONS Nodes which perform a convolution operation or similar should propagate the error pixel to all affected pixels, leading to a blob of pixels in the output. I realise This isn't ideal ; another possibility could be to just zero the mask? But then we lose the error data. At the moment I don't believe we have any \"non-local\" behaviour where pixels affect regions of pixels in the output, so the point could be moot. Filter aberration UNIMPLEMENTED The filter wavelengths are only accurate for pixels in the centre of the image, due to the difference in the light path through the filter at different angles of incidence. Therefore: There will be a system in place to calculate the actual filter wavelength for a given pixel and use this in spectral plots (using the centre of the ROI for the spectrum node) A function should be available to generate the filter aberration value in expr - this would allow an \"image\" to be made of the aberration value which could be used in calculations It should be possible to set the ERROR bit for excessive aberration values Canvas information UNIMPLEMENTED The following should be visible in the canvas as optional overlays: Filter aberration as a heat map (default OFF)","title":"Operating principles"},{"location":"userguide/principles/#operating-principles","text":"PCOT nodes need to follow a set of rules to ensure that the information they process is handled consistently.

Write more in general. Note autodocs . Finish. Parameter file format","title":"Running the graph with a batch file"},{"location":"userguide/batch/params/","text":"Parameter file format The basics Parameter files are just lists of changes to be made to a structure. This structure contains information about the document's inputs and nodes, and how the system should output the resulting data once the document has run. Each line in the file changes an element in the structure. For example, inputs.0.rgb.file = mydata/foo.png tells the system to change input 0's RGB loading method that it should load the file mydata/foo.png . Only one loader can be active for each input, and this change will \"activate\" input 0's RGB loader. Another change could be: k.val = 2 which assumes that there is a node called k , whose parameter val we now set to 2 (this is probably a constant node). Lists Some of the elements in the parameter structure file are lists. We can add to lists by putting a + in the path. For example, there is a list of filenames to load inside each input's multifile loader. We can add elements to it like this: inputs.0.multifile.directory = mydata/multi inputs.0.multifile.filter_pattern = *Filter(?P<lens>L|R)(?P<n>[0-9][0-9]).* inputs.0.multifile.filenames.+ = FilterL02.png inputs.0.multifile.filenames.+ = TestFilterL01image.png inputs.0.multifile.filenames.+ = FilterR10.png This tells the multifile loader where the files are (the directory element), how to decode the names to get a filter (the filter_pattern element) and finally adds three filenames to the filename list. What the + element actually does is create a new item at the end of the list and start modifying that item. In the example above each item is just a string, but they could be structures. Adding a new structure to a list creates a default structure and adds it, and we can then immediately modify it. For example, we can add a new output like this: outputs.+.file = out.csv outputs.0.clobber = y outputs.0.node = spectrum The first line creates a new default output element in the outputs and sets its file to out.csv . The next two lines modify other values within that same output, which is the first output (numbered zero). We can write this more concisely using a relative path. Relative paths The left-hand side of each line is called the \"path\" because it describes how to get to each item we need to change. You'll notice from the above example that there can be a lot of repetition in paths as we change a lot of elements at the same level within the structure. So far we have seen absolute paths describing route in full, but if we start a path with a . - making a relative path - we are assumed to be at the same place as the last change. We can change the previous output example to this: outputs.+.file = out.csv .clobber = y .node = spectrum The first line creates a new output element and sets its file to \"out.csv\". The next two lines modify that output element, because the last thing we set was output.0.file , inside output.0 . We can also modify the input example the same way: inputs.0.multifile.directory = {globaldatadir}/multi .filter_pattern = *Filter(?P<lens>L|R)(?P<n>[0-9][0-9]).* .filenames.+ = FilterL02.png .+ = TestFilterL01image.png .+ = FilterR10.png The leading . means \"stay at the same level,\" which in this case is inputs.0.multifile . Path setters If we write a path without setting a value, it just sets the current path for the next items - this kind of line is called a path setter . We could also write the output example like this: outputs.+ .node = spectrum .file = out.csv .clobber = y The first line creates a new output and sets the path. The next three lines modify the structure at that path - the output just created. Going up levels with multiple dots In the example above we add an output and then modify it. We could add another output by adding an extra set of lines, like this: outputs.+.file = out.csv .clobber = y .node = spectrum outputs.+.file = out2.csv .node = spectrum2 But we can also do this: outputs.+.file = out.csv .clobber = y .node = spectrum ..+.file = out2.csv .node = spectrum2 That's because after the first output, our path is set to output.0. . Using two dots lets us go back up the path one level, to output. , so we can now add a new output. List notation for ordered parameters Some parameters have an implicit ordering. These are marked in the documentation as \"(ordered)\". For example, the circle node type autodocs contain this: croi circle definition (ordered) x: integer (default 0) Centre x coordinate y: integer (default 0) Centre y coordinate r: integer (default -1) Radius That means that while you can set the region of interest within a circle node with this: circle.croi.x = 100 .y = 100 .r = 20 you can also use a list, and the values will be assigned from the list with the order given in the documentation: circle.croi = [100,100,20] The 'run' directive - running multiple times If the file contains a line with just the word run (excluding comments), PCOT will run with the parameters as they stand at the current point in the file. That means you can write things like this: outputs.+.file = double.csv expr.expr = a*2 run outputs.0.file = triple.csv expr.expr = a*3 run outputs.0.file = quad.csv expr.expr = a*4 run Here we are running the same graph three times, with three different expressions in the node called expr . Each time we are modifying the first (and only) output filename. Note that we need to create output for the first run, and then we modify its filename for subsequent runs. Printing messages The print directive allows messages to be printed during the run: outputs.+.file = double.csv print doubling some data... expr.expr = a*2 run outputs.0.file = triple.csv print trebling some data... expr.expr = a*3 run This is particularly useful when using templates, as we will see below. Using Jinja2 templates Before they are run, each parameter file is processed using the Jinja2 templating engine , more typically used to create websites (as is obvious from its documentation). Here is an example of a file written to make use of this facility. It performs some manipulations on an image, writing the results to a single PARC (PCOT archive) file. It will generate four images. outputs.+.file = output.parc .annotations = n # annotations not supported in PARC .node = striproi(a,1) .name = main # the name the output will have in the PARC file .description = Primary output image # description in the PARC run # now we run a loop for values 1,2,3 using Jinja2 {% for i in range(1,4) %} # just one output, keep the same file and settings but append. outputs.0.append = y # we are now appending to the PARC .node = test{{i}} # get output from node1, node2 or node3. .name = testimg{{i}} # call it testimg1, testimg2 or testimg3 .description = Test image {{i}} print processing {{i}} # print a message run {% endfor %} # normally a \"run\" is silently appended to the end of a parameter file, # but this won't happen if the previous command was also a \"run\", which # it will be here. PCOT automatically sets up the following Jinja2 variables for you to use: variable name description {{docpath}} the path to the document (with backslashes replaced by forward slashes) {{docfile}} the name of the document file (i.e. the final part of the path) {{datetime}} the current date and time in ISO 8601 format {{date}} the current date in ISO 8601 format {{count}} the number of times the document has been run (useful in loops) {{vars}} an array of any extra arguments passed on the command line {{parampath}} the path to the parameter file (if one is used, it is \"NoFile\" otherwise) {{paramfile}} the name of the parameter file (if one is used, it is \"NoFile\" otherwise) We also set up some Jinja2 \"filters\" to manipulate filenames, etc.: filter action basename return the last part of a file path: \"foo/bar.png\" becomes \"bar.png\" dirname return the directory part of a file path: \"foo/bar.png\" becomes \"foo\" stripext remove extension: \"foo.bar\" becomes \"foo\" extension get extension: \"foo.bar\" becomes \".bar\" This lets us do things like this, which will add the parameter file name as a prefix to any text output, but strip off any directory elements: output.0.prefix = {{paramfile | basename}} Using outputs (and other lists) in a loop A common use case is writing multiple output files. You may be tempted to do something like this: {{ for i in range(0,10) }} # loop over 10 items inputs.0.envi.filename = input{{i}}.hdr # change input 0 outputs.0.node = sink # set the output .clobber = y # can overwrite files .filename = output{{i}}.png # and change the filename {{ endfor }} That won't work, because output 0 doesn't exist yet. You may try to fix it like this: {{ for i in range(0,10) }} # loop over 10 items inputs.0.envi.filename = input{{i}}.hdr # change input 0 outputs.+.node = sink # create new output! .clobber = y # can overwrite files .filename = output{{i}}.png # and change the filename {{ endfor }} but while that will run it will create a new output each time it goes around the loop! The right way to do it is to create the output and set it up before the loop, only changing the bits you need to: outputs.+.node = sink # create new output! .clobber = y # can overwrite files {{ for i in range(0,10) }} # loop over 10 items inputs.0.envi.filename = input{{i}}.hdr # change input 0 outputs.0.filename = output{{i}}.png # and change the output filename {{ endfor }} Not yet written below here Inputs, outputs and nodes How inputs work is complicated.
