# Updating PCOT

Updating an existing PCOT install should be fairly simple.

* Go into the directory where you installed PCOT before (where you did the `git clone` command)
* Type `git pull` - this should pull the latest release
* Type `poetry install` - this should check for any updated packages and download them
