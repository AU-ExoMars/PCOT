# Updating PCOT

Updating an existing PCOT install should be fairly simple.

* Go into the PCOT root directory - this is the directory which contains
PCOT on your machine, and is usually called `PCOT`.
It should contain directories called `src` and `tests`.
* Type `git pull` - this should get the latest release
* Type `poetry install` - this should check for any updated packages and download them
