# Node serialisation

This page discusses how to serialise the parameters for 
node types. If you don't know what that means, you're either in the wrong
place or haven't read [Writing PCOT plugins](plugins.md).

Most nodes need to store some data. Sometimes this data can just be stored directly, as attributes of the `XForm` object (i.e. the node).  It's not really "polite" programming, but this is the kind of thing you can do with Python.

However, often "parameter" data controlling how the node operates needs to be saved inside the PCOT document file, and loaded when we reopen the file. For example, the *expr* node needs to store a string: the expression to be run. Parameters for some nodes can be  complicated: *multidot* needs to be able to store a list of circular regions of interest, for example.

We also need to do this to handle undo operations - every time a change is made, the entire document is "saved" into an archive in memory so it can be undone.

This process - converting node data into data which can be saved to archives - is called **serialisation**, and there no less than four different mechanisms for doing it. This is largely for historical reasons, but also because the different mechanisms serve different needs:

In order of preference, with the best at the top:

* **TaggedAggregate serialisation** - the data is JSON-serialisable but we want to make it possible to edit it from a batch/parameter file (see [batch mode](/userguide/batch)). **Probably the best choice if you can.**
* **complex serialisation via TaggedAggregate** - the data is not serialisable, but we want to edit it from a parameter file. **Probably the second-best** and suitable where simple TA-serialisation can't handle the more complex data involved.
* **autoserialisation** - for when your data is already JSON-serialisable and you don't need to edit it from a parameter file. It is very simple to implement, but doesn't allow editing from a batch file and doesn't document itself automatically. Used only in legacy nodes.
* **complex serialisation** - for when your data is not directly JSON-serialisable (for example, regions of interest) and you don't need to edit it from a parameter file because it makes no sense (such as painted ROIs)

## TaggedAggregate serialisation

This is the method we use when we want to be able to edit the parameters of nodes in batch mode, using parameter files (see [batch mode](/userguide/batch)). It is probably the best method to use because of this, but it is rather more complicated.

We make use of **tagged aggregate structures**, which can be found in
`pcot.utils.taggedaggregate`. These are dictionaries and lists, but
each has a formal, typed structure with "tags" giving the names of the
members, their types, and default values.

Each is described by a type singleton object which provides descriptions of its elements (these are the "tags" in the name). Calling `create()` on the singleton builds an instance of the structure with all the values filled in with defaults.

### TaggedDictType
The main type used is `TaggedDictType`, which describes the format of a set of key/value pairs. Calling `create()` on one of these objects builds a `TaggedDict` object containing the default values.

The `TaggedDictType` constructor takes a set of keyword arguments. Each key is the same of an element in the dict, and each value describes that element as a tuple of:

* a description used in the documentation
* a type: either a primitive type such as int or str, or another `TaggedAggregateType` subclass for nested structures
* a default value (must be `None` for aggregates, which provide their own defaults)
* for string values, an optional list of acceptable strings

If you call `setOrdered` on the constructed type object you will get an "ordered dict" - this will be serialised as a tuple with the contained data having an implicit ordering.

@@@info
You might wonder why we don't make all tagged dicts ordered, so they
are all serialised as tuples. The answer is that doing that would make
it harder to implement backcompatibility - if we serialise as a tuple,
adding and removing fields in the future becomes difficult. Only 
use ordered dicts for things where we are very unlikely
to change the structure. One advantage is that it is possible to set all values in an ordered dict in one line inside a batch file.

For example, here is a `TaggedDictType` definition for a rectangle:

```python
taggedRectType = TaggedDictType(
    x=("The x coordinate of the top left corner", Number, 0),
    y=("The y coordinate of the top left corner", Number, 0),
    w=("The width of the rectangle", Number, 10),
    h=("The height of the rectangle", Number, 10)).setOrdered()
```
We are using `Number` here to indicate that either ints or floats are acceptable. We can then create a rectangle `TaggedDict` and access its values:
```python
r = taggedRectType.create()            # create TaggedDict from type
print(f"Rectangle at {r.x}, {r.y}")    # show values
r.w = 20                               # set values
r.h = 30
```

@@@info
Bear in mind that there are functions for generating rectangle and colour type object in
pcot.utils.taggedaggregates: taggedColourType and taggedRectType. You probably shouldn't
create a rectangle type yourself.
@@@

We can also specify that a parameter is another `TaggedDict`, allowing us to build complex nested structures. Here we nest the `taggedRectType` we defined above in another dict type:
```python
taggedThingType = TaggedDictType(
    rect=("The rectangle", taggedRectType),
    somenumber=("Some numerical value",Number,0))
```

### TaggedListType
These objects describe lists, and calling `create()` on them generates a `TaggedList` item. This is rarely done directly - it's more usual for a `TaggedDictType` to specify that one of its values is a list, in which case the list object is created when the containing `TaggedDict` is created.

Here's an example where the dict contains both our rectangle type and a list of rectangles:

```python
taggedThingType = TaggedDictType(
    main=("The main rectangle", taggedRectType),
    others=("Some other rectangles", TaggedListType(taggedRectType,0)),
    somenumber=("Some numerical value",Number,0))
```

We can then create our parameters and add a new default rect to the list:
```python
thing = taggedThingType.create()
listOfThings.others.append_default()
```    
We can then access these items:
```python
print(taggedThingType.others.[0].x)
```

The `TaggedListType` constructor takes the following arguments:

* Type of item (must be a TaggedAggregateType subclass or a primitive type  - int, str, etc.)
* Default length (if a list of aggregates) or default list (if a list of primitives)
* Optional default value to append when a new item is created, ignored for lists of aggregates which will create their own default item

For more details on how to use these structures, read the tests in `tests/test_taggedaggs.py`.

You'll note that all the elements of a TaggedAggregate structure are JSON-serialisable[^1], although
some can be numpy arrays. However, the nature of the structure allows defaults - and documentation -
to be generated automatically.

## Using TaggedAggregates to serialise nodes

To use a TaggedAggregate to serialise node data, create a `TaggedDictType ` and assign
it to the `params` member of the `XFormType` in the constructor. For example:
```python
        self.params = TaggedDictType(
            mul=("multiplicative factor (done first)", float, 1.0),
            add=("additive constant (done last)", float, 0.0))
```
When a new node is created, a default structure will be created from this type and stored in the
node's `params` field where it can be accessed from the `perform` method:
```python
output = node.params.add + node.params.mul * node.getInput(0, Datum.IMG)
```
When the node is serialised, the structure will be serialised.

## complex TaggedAggregate serialisation (CTAS)

The previous method dealt with data which can be JSON-serialised directly. If
we need to modify non-JSON-serialisable data with parameter files, we need to
do something similar to the complex serialisation method described above but
going through a TaggedAggregate: we set the TaggedAggregate from our complex
data, and then PCOT will serialise that.

To do this, we write code as before to store the data in a `TaggedDict` in `node.params`, and we store any simple data we have in that structure. Then we write a `serialise` method containing code which converts our more complex data into a simpler form and stores it in `node.params` so it can be serialised. Here's an example:

```python
def serialise(self, node):
    # fill in the node.params with data
    node.params.foo = some_data_or_other
    node.params.bar = some_data_or_other

    # we don't return anything, because node.params will have been set to
    # represent our data; we don't need to add anything directly to the
    # JSON-serialisable dict.
    
    return None
```

This method is also used by the legacy serialisation mechanism, where it would return a JSON dict directly. Here we need to return None instead.

We must also write a `nodeDataFromParams` method. This takes a node, and uses its `params` field (which will be a TaggedDict, of course) to set the node's internal data:

```python
def nodeDataFromParams(self, node):
    # convert some data in node.params into our own private data
    our_data = some_function_of(node.params.foo, node.params.bar)
```

**Maybe**

Types and TaggedAggregate type objects can be "wrapped" in `Maybe` objects if they might be null:
```python
    tdt = TaggedDictType(
        a=("a", int, 10),
        b=("b", Maybe(str), "foo"),        # string or null
        c=("c", float, 3.14)
    )
    td = tdt.create()           # create new dict
    td.b = "hello"              # this is fine
    td.b = None                 # and so is this
```

@@@info
Note: I would have used Optional from the typing package, but that can only take actual types -
not the type objects we use here.

@@@danger
Avoid using Maybe for tagged aggregates etc., because you can't
*create* a new one using a parameter file, just modify values in an
existing one.

**TaggedVariantDicts**

Sometimes it is necessary to store different kinds of object in a list. We can do this with
TaggedAggregates, provided the objects are all TaggedDicts and there is a field in all the dicts
which tells us which type it is - a "discriminator". 

[You can find more details on TVDs here](taggedvardicts.md)


@@@info
**Where to find examples**

Probably the most complex but straightforward example of CTAS is the *gradient* node. This
converts a monochrome image to a false colour RGB gradient based on a set of gradient colours. This
exists as a pcot.utils.gradient.Gradient object which is a wrapper around a list of (x,(r,g,b)) tuples
defining the colour *r,g,b* at value *x*. 

The CTAS methods are responsible for converting tagged aggregate data and this
Gradient object. They also handle a *preset* string which can override the
data when set from a [parameter file](/userguide/batch).

[Regions of interest are a rather more complex example...](roi_ctas.md)

## Autoserialisation

This is the serialisation method used for a few legacy nodes and nodes which don't require batch editing, like *comment*. 

In the simplest case, the data stored in the `XForm` object for a particular
node is already JSON-serialisable: that is, it is either a Python
primitive type (number, string, tuple, list or dict) or a Numpy array
(PCOT handles serialising these automatically). In this case you can simply
list the names of the attributes in a tuple called `autoserialise` in the `XFormType`,
along with some defaults which are used in case the items are not found in the saved data.

For example, the constructor for `XFormSpectrum` could look like this (not any more, because it now uses TA-serialisation):

```python
        super().__init__("spectrum", "data", "0.0.0")
        self.autoserialise = ('sortlist', 'errorbarmode', 'legendFontSize', 'axisFontSize', 'stackSep', 'labelFontSize',
                              'bottomSpace', 'colourmode', 'rightSpace',
                              # these have defaults because they were developed later.
                              ('ignorePixSD', False),
                              ('bandwidthmode', BANDWIDTHMODE_NONE),
                              )
        for i in range(NUMINPUTS):
            self.addInputConnector(str(i), Datum.IMG, "a single line in the plot")
        self.addOutputConnector("data", Datum.DATA, "a CSV output (use 'dump' or 'sink' to read it)")
```
Note that the default values are optional - if you don't specify a default you can just
use the attribute name rather than a `(name, default)` tuple, but you will get an error if
you try to load from data which doesn't have that attribute stored.

When the system serialises the node it will read the named fields from the node, and it will
do the reverse when it deserialises a node (i.e. load it from an archive).

## Complex serialisation

In this case, we have data which isn't JSON-serialisable, and where it doesn't make any sense to have the parameters editable outside the PCOT user interface. Here, we add `serialise` and `deserialise` methods to the `XFormType` to 
convert our data to and from data
which is JSON-serialisable. The `serialise` method will take the node and return a dict
(which is JSON-serialisable), while the `deserialise` method will take the node and the dict
and set the appropriate values a newly created node. The dict returned by `serialise` will be merged
with the dict generated by autoserialisation and other, general node data (e.g. canvas data). 
Make sure you use unique names and not any of:
```txt
canvas, displayName, inputTypes, ins, outs, mapping, md5, type, ver, w, xy, outputTypes
```

An example: imagine our node stores a list of objects of some class
`Foo`. We could write our methods thus:

```python
def serialise(self, node):
    return {'foolist': [(x.a, x.b) for x in node.foo_list]}

def deserialise(self, node, d):
    node.foo_list = [Foo(a, b) for a, b in d['foolist']]
```    
In this case we are converting the Foo objects into tuples to serialise them,
and constructing them from the tuples when we deserialise. It would probably be
better to write `Foo` so that it can serialise itself and has a deserialise constructor:

```
class Foo:
    def __init__(self...):
        ...
        
    def serialise(self)->dict:
        return ...
        
    @staticmethod
    def deserialise(d: dict):
        return Foo(...)
```

and

```python
def serialise(self, node):
    return {'foolist': [x.serialise() for x in node.foo_list]}
    
def deserialise(self, node, d):
    node.foo_list = [Foo.deserialise(x) for x in d['foolist']]
```    

[^1]: i.e. they can be turned directly into JSON - they are primitive types (int, float, str etc.), dicts, lists, or tuples.
