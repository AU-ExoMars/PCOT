# Getting started with PCOT

## Installation
PCOT is available in two forms:

* **Standalone executables** for Windows and Linux (and hopefully MacOS soon) - these are 
suitable for people who do not need to add their own plugins or use PCOT as a Python library.
They can be obtained from the Aberystwyth team or from the Releases on GitHub.
* **A Python program typically installed with Anaconda and Poetry** which can be obtained by
downloading the source and running the
[installation procedure](index.md#installing-with-anaconda).

## Running the application

* If you are using the standalone version, simply run the executable you downloaded.
* If you installed into an Anaconda environment you should start a command line shell
(an Anaconda Powershell on Windows) and run the following commands:

        conda activate pcot
        pcot
