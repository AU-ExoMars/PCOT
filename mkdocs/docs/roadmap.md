# Development roadmap

This is a rough guide, and things may change! It's essentially
a list of things that need to be done in approximate priority order.

* Change from Conda+Poetry to UV for virtual environment and dependency
management. This will change the installation procedure.
* Change to PySide6. This will take some time.

* Store camera data separately from calibration target reflectances
* Enhance the reflectance node to handle this data and also different angles
* Cull nodes which can be *expr* functions
* Reorganise the node palette
* Obtain user stories and feedback

* Filter aberration
    * Filter aberration parameters need to be obtained and added to config
    * Node (or func??) to convert aberration to image
    * Calculate and process in canvas spectrum
    * Calculate and process in *spectrum* node

* Obtain user stories for analysis of HK data (which could potentially
get messy, as these are likely to be time series)
