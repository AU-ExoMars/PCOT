# Development roadmap

This is a rough guide, and things may change!

## Next major release: 0.9.0

* New node parameter system:
    * makes the node self-documenting (node parameters appear as a table,
    both in the "help" window and in the on-line documentation
    * provides better type and range checking when the node is modified in code
    * provides support for batch files
* You now create nodes by dragging from the palette with the left mouse button
* batch runner
    * allows a PCOT file to be loaded and its parameters (i.e. node settings,
    inputs and outputs) to be modifed with a "batch file" before running. The
    outputs can be saved to files. 
    * Batch files have a simple but flexible and powerful language for
    describing the changes to nodes and inputs, and how the results should
    be written to files.
    
## Release 0.10.0

* "Camera pack" files which hold filter and calibration data for particular
setups in an extensible format
* Flatfield calibration code


## Future releases

* Reorganise the node palette
* Obtain user stories and feedback

* Calibration: the PCT detection node is fine, but does nothing!

* Filter aberration
    * Filter aberration parameters need to be obtained and added to config
    * Node (or func??) to convert aberration to image
    * Calculate and process in canvas spectrum
    * Calculate and process in *spectrum* node

* Obtain user stories for analysis of HK data (which could potentially
get messy, as these are likely to be time series)
