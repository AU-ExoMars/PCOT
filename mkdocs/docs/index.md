# PCOT - the PanCam Operations Toolkit

PCOT is a Python program and library which allows users to manipulate 
multispectral images and other data from the ExoMars *Rosalind Franklin* rover.

@@@ warning
This is an early alpha version with serious limitations.

* There is no calibration code of any kind (although the preliminaries are in place)
* PDS4 import capabilities are poor - we only support spec-rad products
from the ExoMars PANCAM instrument - but we also support
    * ENVI provided the images are 32-bit float BSQ
    * RGB PNGs
    * multispectral images made of multiple monochrome PNGs
    * and adding new PDS4 formats should be relatively straightforward
* Data quality and uncertainty data are not yet handled in any way
* There are probably a *lot* of useful operations missing
* There are certainly a *lot* of bugs.
