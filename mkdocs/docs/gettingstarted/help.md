# Getting help

## Nodes
Inside the PCOT app there are three ways to get help on a node:

* Double-clicking on the little blue box in the top right
corner of that node in the graph,
* Using the right-click context menu on a node,
* Using the right-click context menu on a button in the palette.

The node help texts are also available
in the [automatically generated documentation](/autodocs). If this isn't
enough, don't hesitate to contact the Aberystwyth team.

## Expressions
Doing the above on an *expr* node will tell you what
operations, functions and properties are available. This text is also
available in the automatically generated [documentation for this
node](/autodocs/expr). 

You can also get help on properties and functions by 
right clicking in the log box at the bottom and selecting the appropriate
option. Inside the expression box in the *expr* node, you can right-click
on most things and ask for help.
