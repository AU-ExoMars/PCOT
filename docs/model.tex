\section{The data model}
The data model consists of two parts --- the data itself (largely
image cube data) and the graph. By far the most important kind of data
from the point of view of this document is the image data, which ties
into the user interface in complex ways. Other forms of data do exist,
but these are much simpler.


\subsection{Graph and nodes}
The graph is a directed graph of nodes represented by the 
\texttt{XFormGraph} class. Each node is an instance of \texttt{XForm}
(short for ``transform node''). The function of each node is
determined by its \texttt{type} field, which references an
\texttt{XFormType} singleton. See Fig.~\ref{xform.pdf} for an overview.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\center
\includegraphics[width=4in]{xform.pdf}
\caption{\texttt{XForm} and graph model}
\label{xform.pdf}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{XFormType and type registration}
\label{xformtype}
Each node type is represented by a subclass of \texttt{XFormType},
and each subclass has a singleton to which nodes of that type link.
For example, the \emph{rect} node's behaviour is specified by
the \texttt{XformRect} class, which has a singleton instance. All
\texttt{XForm} nodes which are \emph{rect} nodes have a \texttt{type} field
pointing to this singleton.

The singletons are automatically created and registered when the class
is defined, through the \texttt{@xformtype} decorator. This does the
following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creates an instance of the class;
\item Creates an MD5 hash of the class' source code which is stored
inside the type singleton for version control;
\item Changes the semantics of the class constructor so that
it always returns the instance we just created (thus making the class
a singleton).
\end{itemize}
The base constructor for \texttt{XFormType} adds the singleton
to a dictionary class variable \texttt{allTypes}, so we can always
obtain the singleton object and create new nodes which perform that
node type.

\subsubsection{XFormType methods}
In order to perform a node's action, the type classes must contain
the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{init(node:XForm)} : initialise any extra data inside
the node required to perform this type's behaviour
\item \texttt{perform(node:XForm)} : perform this node's behaviour ---
read any inputs, manipulate the data, set the outputs.
\item \texttt{createTab(node:XForm, window:MainWindow)} : create a UI tab to edit/view this node.
\end{itemize}
Several other methods may optionally be overridden.

\subsubsection{Linkage}
\texttt{XForm} node objects are linked together by their inputs.
Each \texttt{XForm} contains an \texttt{inputs} list indexed by
input number. The length of this list is determined by the number
of inputs the type object specifies. Each entry is a $(node,output)$
tuple where $node$ is a reference to another \texttt{XForm} and
$output$ is the index of an output on that \texttt{XForm}.

Methods are provided in \texttt{XForm} for connecting and disconnecting nodes
(also checking for cycles and providing basic type checking), and getting inputs
and setting outputs inside the type's \texttt{perform()} method.

\subsection{Performing the graph}
\label{graphperform}
The graph needs to be ``performed'' --- its nodes executed --- whenever
the data changes, which is generally whenever the graph is edited or
a node control changed in a tab.
This is done by calling \texttt{changed()} on the node's tab, which calls 
\texttt{changed()} on the tab's node's graph, passing in the node. Here is the 
relevant code in \texttt{ui.tabs.Tab}:
\begin{lstlisting}
    def changed(self):
        self.node.graph.changed(self.node)
\end{lstlisting}
The \texttt{XFormGraph.changed()} method takes a node, and either calls
\texttt{performNodes()} on the main graph passing in that node, or, if the
node is inside a macro prototype graph (q.v.), copies the prototype graph to
all its instances and runs \texttt{performNodes()} for all those instances
(see Sec.~\ref{macroineff} for why this is a problem).

The \texttt{XFormGraph.performNodes()} method itself takes a single argument and performs
either the entire graph or a portion of the graph starting at a particular node.
If the argument is None, the internal list of all nodes in the graph is traversed looking
for nodes with no inputs and these are performed. If the argument is not None that node
is performed. Nodes are performed by calling their \texttt{perform()} method. This will
recursively run the child nodes, but only when they are ready to run. 

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Performing a node}
The \texttt{XForm.perform()} method will run a node, and recursively run all child nodes, although
there are some complexities here (mainly to accommodate macros). It will not perform the node if it 
has already run in this call to \texttt{performNodes()} or if it is not ready to run (some inputs do not yet have values):
\begin{algorithmic}
\IF{node has not already run \textbf{and} node is ready to run}
\STATE clear all outputs
\STATE run the node type singleton's \texttt{perform()} method on the node
\STATE mark node as having run
\FORALL{$t$ in open tabs for this node}
\STATE $t$\texttt{.onNodeChanged()}
\ENDFOR
\FORALL{$c$ in child nodes}
\STATE perform node $c$
\ENDFOR
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
A node is ready to run if it has no inputs which do not yet have values set. This is
determined by checking the outputs of the nodes from which the inputs come to see if
they have yet been set with values. The \texttt{performNodes()} method is called from only two places:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{XFormGraph.changed(node)}: when the graph or a node in a graph has been changed. This is the most
frequent call, and is typically called with a node to avoid running the whole graph. The node is passed down into
\texttt{performNodes()}).
\item \texttt{XFormMacro.perform(node)}: when a node which contains a macro instance is being performed (see
Sec.~\ref{macros} for more details).
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{XFormGraph.changed()} method is called from several places:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{XFormGraph.runAll()} : called when a graph is explicitly run.
\item \texttt{XForm.disconnect()} and \texttt{XForm.connect()}: when connections between nodes are made or broken.
\item \texttt{XForm.setEnabled()}: when a node is enabled or disabled.
\item \texttt{Tab.changed()}: when a tab signals that a node it controls has had a parameter change.
\item \texttt{XFormGraph.deserialise()}: when a graph has been loaded.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Image data}
Most classes making up the image data 
model are described in the \texttt{pancamimage.py} file, including the main \texttt{ImageCube}
class. Some additional classes describing where images can come from are in \texttt{channelsource.py}.
The model is shown in outline in Fig.~\ref{image.pdf} although some links to channel sources
and mapping from nodes are omitted; these will be explained later.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\center
\includegraphics[width=6in]{image.pdf}
\caption{Outline UML class diagram of image model}
\label{image.pdf}
\end{figure}

The main class is \texttt{ImageCube}: this encapsulates a numpy array
\texttt{img}
which is the actual image data cube in the form
of a $w \times h \times depth$ array. The data type is 32-bit floating
point, and images are typically normalized to the range [0,1].

\begin{notebox}
In this document I have a tendency to refer to image data as both ``image'' and ``image cube.''
Both terms refer to the same thing: an array of floating point image data, with 1 or more channels
of information. There is no upper limit on the number of channels in an image (or image cube)
beyond system memory.
\end{notebox}


\subsubsection{IChannelSource and its implementations}
Each \texttt{ImageCube} has a number of channels, and for each channel there must be a corresponding
entry in the \texttt{sources} list. This describes where that channel came from, so that (typically) filter
information can be preserved, where appropriate, through the graph. The sources for each channel are a set
of \texttt{IChannelSource} objects. For example, if an image was loaded through the RGB loader, it might
have three ``fake'' channel sources for red, green and blue. Thus the sources will be 
\begin{v}
[ {RED}, {GREEN}, {BLUE} ]
\end{v}
i.e.\ a list of three sets, each with a single source.
If the image is then converted to greyscale, this could
become
\begin{v}
[ {RED,GREEN,BLUE}, {RED,GREEN,BLUE}, {RED,GREEN,BLUE} ]
\end{v}
because each channel now contains information from the red, green and blue channels in the source file.
The \texttt{RED}, \texttt{GREEN} and \texttt{BLUE} values refer in this case to \texttt{FileChannelSourceNoFilter} objects
which contain ``fake'' filter information and a filename identifier.
Each \texttt{IChannelSource} contains methods for accessing:
\begin{itemize}
\item an \textbf{identifier string} for the source from which the channel was acquired (typically a filename or data ID);
\item a \textbf{filter} and methods for obtaining the filter name, filter position and an actual filter reference (for extra data such as centre wavelength) (note
that much of this information will be ``fake'' for images loaded from plain RGB files);
\item methods for getting string descriptors for this source.
\end{itemize}

Nodes generate and process this information in different ways. For example, a \emph{gradient} node takes a single channel and converts it into an RGB image with
a colour gradient: here, the output image's sources are ``internal RGB'' sources with no identifier or sensible filter data because the output's colour
is entirely artificial. In contrast, a the \emph{curve} for performing a sigmoid function on all channels of an image will give the output image the
same sources as the input image.

Sources are used to keep track of each channel as it moves through the graph so they can be processed and displayed appropriately:
Fig.~\ref{app.png} shows a typical node in the ``node controls and output'' section. This section, as it does in many nodes,
contains a ``canvas'' displaying an image. Above the canvas are three combo boxes which select the channels in the image cube to display on the canvas,
and these are typically labelled by a string generated from the source data for each channel (along with the index). Sources are also used
to select channels to combine and manipulate in those nodes which do so.

\subsubsection{RGB channel mappings}
The previous section briefly mentions the three RGB mapping combo boxes at the
top of the canvas component in the node controls in Fig~\ref{app.png}. In
canvases --- components which display images --- a multi-channel image cube
must be displayed as RGB data. The combo boxes control how this is done, and
the data is made persistent in a slightly complicated way, as shown in Fig.~\ref{rgb.pdf}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\center
\includegraphics[width=6in]{rgb.pdf}
\caption{RGB mapping classes}
\label{rgb.pdf}
\end{figure}

The relationships will hopefully become clearer when I come to describe how nodes work in more
detail, but for now:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \texttt{ChannelMapping} object consists of three integers giving the indices of 
the channels in an image cube to display in the red, green and blue channels on screen.
\item An \texttt{XForm} (i.e.\ a node) may need to show an image on a canvas. If so, it 
will use the \texttt{mapping} field in \texttt{XForm} to store a mapping. This is provided
as a convenience, not all node classes will use it, and some may need to create more if they 
display more than one image.
\item When an \texttt{XForm} creates an image for display or passes
one through, it sets the mapping of the image to the mapping of the node. This is used in the
\texttt{rgb()} method to generate the RGB representation.
\item When an \texttt{XForm} is opened for modification, it creates a subclass of \texttt{Tab}.
This will contain a \texttt{Canvas}, which is given a reference to the mapping inside the
\texttt{XForm}. It needs this so that the mapping can be modified even when no image is present.
\end{itemize}
This may seem rather redundant, but
\begin{itemize}
\item We need the mapping to be owned by the node, so it can be serialised and persists when
there is no image and no open tab.
\item We need to have a reference to the mapping in the canvas, so it can be manipulated by
the combo boxes even when no image is present.
\item Finally, we need a reference to the mapping in the image so that \texttt{rgb()} can be called
on the image when it is input into another node. This is used in nodes like \emph{inset}, which
operate entirely on RGB representations --- it's much neater if these are the RGB representations
output by the nodes which feed in.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Regions of interest}
Regions of interest belong to images, and modify how nodes process those
images. They are added to images by region of interest nodes such as
\emph{rect}. Figs.~\ref{app.png} and \ref{graph.png} show this in action:
\begin{itemize}
\item A file is read in, producing an image cube
\item A \emph{rect} node adds a region of interest to this image. The outputs are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the image with the rectangle added to its list of ROIs;
\item the image cropped to the bounding box of the list of ROIs (at the moment, just this rectangle)'
\item an RGB representation of the image (according to the previous node's canvas RGB mapping);
annotated with the rectangle and some text, and also an ROI added describing the rectangle;
\item the rectangle datum itself.
\end{itemize}
\item a \emph{decorr stretch} takes the annotated RGB representation output and imposes a decorrelation
stretch --- but only on the regions of interest in the image (in this case, inside the rectangle)
\item a \emph{histequal} node performs a histogram equalisation, again honouring the regions of interest
which have been passed through the previous node unchanged.
\end{itemize}
As shown in Fig.~\ref{image.pdf}, each image contains a list of \texttt{ROI} objects,
each of which is an instantiation of a subclass of \texttt{ROI}. 

To honouring regions of interest inside a node's \texttt{perform()} method:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ImageCube.subimage()} will return a \texttt{SubImageCubeROI} object. This encapsulates
a numpy array containing the image bounded to a rectangle around the regions of interest and
a boolean mask (again as a numpy array) specifying which pixels in this rectangle are actually
in regions of interest.
\item The manipulation can now be performed on the \texttt{img} field of this ``subimage,'' but
only on those pixels whose values are true in the corresponding \texttt{mask} field.
\item The modified pixels can be ``spliced'' into the original image cube, creating a new image
cube, using the \texttt{modifyWithSub} method.
\end{itemize}
This example shows the operation of the decorrelation stretch:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    def perform(self,node):
        img = node.getInput(0)
        if img is None:
            node.img = None
        elif not node.enabled:
            node.img = img
        elif img.channels != 3:
            ui.error("Can't decorr stretch images with other than 3 channels")
        else:
            subimage = img.subimage()
            newimg = decorrstretch(subimage.img, subimage.mask)
            node.img = img.modifyWithSub(subimage, newimg)
        if node.img is not None:
            node.img.setMapping(node.mapping)
        node.setOutput(0, node.img)
\end{lstlisting}
There are several checks for whether the node is actually enabled, and whether there is an image
present to stretch, but the core lines are these:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
            subimage = img.subimage()
            newimg = decorrstretch(subimage.img, subimage.mask)
            node.img = img.modifyWithSub(subimage, newimg)
\end{lstlisting}
The \texttt{decorrstretch} takes two arguments: the numpy array containing the pixels which bound
the ROIs, and the mask for those pixels in that array which are in the ROIs. It returns an image
of the same size, which is then spliced back into the original image. The new image returned
will have the same channel sources, the same ROIs and the same RGB mapping.

\begin{notebox}
Much of the ROI system is work in progress, particularly combining
multiple ROIs. This documentation might change.
\end{notebox}


\subsection{Macros}
\label{macros}
Macros are one of the more complex parts of the PCOT data model, so it's
important that they are documented here. First, a quick description
of how they work from a user standpoint.

Users can create a new macro, which will open a window with a new graph in it.
This is distinguished from the main window by its slightly different
background colour. The user can create and manipulate transform nodes inside
this graph, as usual. This is the \textbf{prototype graph} for the macro.
The user should create special input and output nodes inside this graph
to allow data to flow into and out of the macro.

When a new macro is created, a button for that macro appears in the ``palette''
on the right of the app window. Clicking on this button will create
an \textbf{instance} of the macro inside the main graph. This is a
node which contains a copy of the prototype graph --- it must be a copy,
because multiple instances of the macro with different data may exist.
When the user edits the prototype graph (including the parameters of 
any nodes within it) the changes are copied to the instance graphs for
that macro. Consider the situation in Fig.~\ref{macroobjs.pdf}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\center
\includegraphics[width=5in]{macroobjs.pdf}
\caption{An example of a graph containing macros}
\label{macroobjs.pdf}
\end{figure}
This contains three instance nodes of a single macro. 
I have ``zoomed in'' on one of the instances, showing that it is connected
to three other nodes: two on its inputs, one on its outputs.
When this main graph runs, the following happens:
\begin{itemize}
\item Node 1 is able to run, does so, and sets its output
\item The macro instance cannot yet run
\item Node 2 is able to run, does so, and sets its output
\item The macro instance can now run:
\begin{itemize}
\item The macro instance node copies its input data
into the input nodes contained within the instance graph
\item The input nodes in the instance graph are run
\item The nodes dependent on those input nodes are run (i.e.\ the
instance graph proper)
\item The output nodes in the instance graph are run, copying their
inputs into the macro instance node's outputs
\item the instance now has now completed its run
\end{itemize}
\item Node 3 can now run, reading its inputs from the macro instance node.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Macro inefficiencies}
\label{macroineff}
As noted above in Sec.~\ref{graphperform}, all the nodes in all instance
graphs are run whenever the prototype graph is changed. This is very
inefficient and may cause considerable delays. It's done simply by forcing all
\texttt{XFormMacro} nodes which are instances of the macro to perform themselves. Here
is the relevant part of \texttt{XFormGraph.changed()}:
\begin{lstlisting}
    # distribute changes in macro prototype to instances.
    # what we do here is go through all instances of the macro. 
    # We copy the changed prototype to the instances, then run
    # the instances in the graphs which contain them (usually the
    # main graph).
    # This could be optimised to run only the relevant (changed) component
    # within the macro, but that's very hairy.

    for inst in self.proto.instances:
        inst.instance.copyProto()
        inst.graph.performNodes(inst)
\end{lstlisting}
Here, \texttt{inst} is an XFormMacro node inside the graph which contains the
macro, it is not the instance graph inside the \texttt{inst} node. Thus
\texttt{inst.graph} will be the main graph (for an non-nested macro). The
\texttt{self} value, however, is the macro prototype graph, because this
method was called on an object inside that graph. This code therefore calls
\texttt{performNodes()} on the main graph to run the XFormMacro node inside
that graph. 

In an ideal world, this process --- calling \texttt{changed()} --- would identify
the instance node which corresponds to the prototype node which was changed, and only
run that inside the instance graph for the macro. The child nodes of the instance node
would then need to be run.


\subsection{User interface}
The user interface is mainly in the \texttt{ui} package, although each
node type's file contains its UI code (a subclass of \texttt{ui.tabs.Tab}.
A reasonably full view of the system is shown as a class diagram
in Fig.~\ref{ui.pdf}.
The main files involved are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ui/mainwindow.py}: the main window classes;
\item \texttt{ui/tabs.py}: the \texttt{DocktableTabWindow} and \texttt{Tab}
classes (also the \texttt{ExpandedTab} class for when a tab is undocked);
\item \texttt{ui/canvas.py}: the Canvas widget for viewing image cube slices;
\item \texttt{graphview.py}: contains \texttt{GraphView}, the
\texttt{QGraphicsView} subclass which encapulates a view on the graph scene;
\item \texttt{graphscene.py}: contains \texttt{XFormGraphScene},
the \texttt{QGraphicsScene} subclass which contains a set of 2D objects
representing an \texttt{XFormGraph} and its nodes. It also contains the
classes representing those 2D objects (subclasses of various Qt graphics item
classes).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\center
\includegraphics[width=4in]{ui.pdf}
\caption{UI class diagram}
\label{ui.pdf}
\end{figure}


\clearpage
\subsubsection{The main window}
The main window class is \texttt{ui.mainwindow.MainUI}. They contain the
following main widgets:
\begin{itemize}
\item a \texttt{QTabWidget} to hold the dockable tabs (tab docking is
handled by the \texttt{DocktableTab} superclass);
\item a \texttt{GraphView} widget to manage viewing and manipulating
the graph;
\item a \texttt{Palette} to contain the buttons to create new nodes
\end{itemize}
The bottom pane contains various widgets, such as the log console and
caption control combo box.

Main windows are created:
\begin{itemize}
\item when the application opens the first empty main graph in \texttt{main.py}
\item when a new, empty main graph window is created
\item when a window for a macro prototype graph is created
via \texttt{createMacroWindow()}.
\end{itemize}
There are some ownership oddities here. In the first two cases
the \texttt{MainUI} constructor is called with no arguments. This will
cause it to create a new \texttt{XFormGraph} which the window will own.
In the last case, the constructor is informed that the graph is a macro
prototype. This causes the UI to be created slightly differently. 
The \texttt{createMacroWindow()} method then sets the graph to the macro's
prototype, which is owned by the \texttt{XFormMacro}.

In both cases, the \texttt{XFormGraphScene} contains a Qt Graphics Scene
which is constructed and updated from the graph. This is viewed in
the main window through the \texttt{GraphView} class. Both these classes
accept various user actions and use them to modify the graph.
