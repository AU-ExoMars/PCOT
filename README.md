# PCOT

This is the prototype of the Pancam Operations Toolkit. It's a Python
program with a number of dependencies:

* PyQt
* OpenCV
* numpy
* scikit-image
* pyqtgraph
* matplotlib

A short one-liner script to create an Anaconda environment to run
the program can be found in **createCondaEnv**: it will create an
environment called **dev**. After installing
Anaconda, run this script. This may take a while!
Then activate the **dev** environment with **conda activate dev**.
